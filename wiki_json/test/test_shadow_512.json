    "text": "Initially , by analogy with the neutron magic number 126 , the next proton shell was also expected to occur at element 126 , too far away from the synthesis capabilities of the mid @-@ 20th century to achieve much theoretical attention . In 1966 , new values for the potential and spin @-@ orbit interaction in this region of the periodic table contradicted this and predicted that the next proton shell would occur instead at element 114 , and that nuclides in this region would be as stable against spontaneous fission as many heavy nuclei such as lead @-@ 208 . The expected closed neutron shells in this region were at neutron number 184 or 196 , thus making 298Fl and 310Fl candidates for being doubly magic . 1972 estimates predicted a half @-@ life of about a year for 298Fl , which was expected to be near a large island of stability with the longest half @-@ life at darmstadtium @-@ 294 ( 1010 years , comparable to that of 232Th ) . After the synthesis of the first isotopes of elements 112 through 118 at the turn of the 21st century , it was found that the synthesized neutron @-@ deficient isotopes were stabilized against fission . In 2008 it was thus hypothesized that the stabilization against fission of these nuclides was due to their being oblate nuclei , and that a region of oblate nuclei was centred on 288Fl . Additionally , new theoretical models showed that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f7 / 2 ( filled at element 114 ) and 2f5 / 2 ( filled at element 120 ) was smaller than expected , so that element 114 no longer appeared to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell . The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around 306Ubb , but the expected low half @-@ life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging . Nevertheless , the island of stability is still expected to exist in this region of the periodic table , and nearer its centre ( which has not been approached closely enough yet ) some nuclides , such as 291Uup and its alpha- and beta @-@ decay daughters , may be found to decay by positron emission or electron capture and thus move into the centre of the island . Due to the expected high fission barriers , any nucleus within this island of stability decays exclusively by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay , both of which would bring the nuclei closer to the beta stability line where the island is expected to be . Electron capture is needed to reach the island , which is problematic because it is not certain that electron capture becomes a major decay mode in this region of the chart of nuclides ."

Incomplete crafting \" kits \" to create original reborns can also be purchased from various online stores . There is a large price range depending on the quality of the doll , but they can sell anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars . There are many factors to look for when purchasing a reborn . If the complexion is too dark this is called a blue baby , and indicates it was dyed excessively or uses colored sand for weight that could have seeped into the vinyl . The type of material used to weight the reborn should be considered because some materials do not react well with vinyl and will cause it to deteriorate . The doll should not be shiny . This indicates the doll was washed with acetone before painting , which prevents the color from correctly sticking to the doll 's surface . It may also be caused by the type of paint used to color the doll . This is corrected with a heat set matte varnish . The parts used are important , as original parts may be replaced . The replacement parts must be appropriately proportioned with the doll and made of quality material . At times having the original body retains the doll 's value either because it was made to fit that specific doll , or the artist left a signature mark . Eye brand , size , fitting , and alignment should be closely examined . Another feature to observe is the type of paint used for coloring and whether the doll is realistic in its details such as veins and newborn imperfections .

These include uses of this volley gun by the characters Patrick Harper in Sharpe and Jim Bowie in The Alamo . Nock was the manufacturer , but not the inventor , of this weapon . Despite its portrayal in film , this weapon was not very practical as a hand weapon due its very severe recoil , often causing injuries , and the time needed to reload the seven barrels . It was necessary to abandon the rifling of the early prototypes and reduce the charge to keep this problem manageable . Intended as a naval weapon fired from the rigging to repel boarders on the deck , it was retired by the Royal Navy in 1804 .

A direct line with no intermediate stops is estimated to cost NOK 11 billion , while a line via Kolbotn would cost 13 @.@ 5 billion . The report also argued that the intermediate stops would decrease capacity and increase travel time for all passengers departing south of Ski and traveling north . The exclusion of Kolbotn would also increase the importance of Ski as a regional public transport hub . In 2009 , the Rail Administration abandoned the plans to build the line via Kolbotn , stating that it was more important to secure a fast connection to Ski .

He settled on Kelmscott Manor in the village of Kelmscott , Oxfordshire , obtaining a joint tenancy on the building with Rossetti in June . Morris adored the building , which was constructed circa 1570 , and would spend much time in the local countryside . Conversely , Rossetti would be unhappy at Kelmscott , and eventually suffered a mental breakdown . Morris divided his time between London and Kelmscott , however when Rossetti was there he would not spend more than three days at a time at the latter . He was also fed up with his family home in Queen Square , deciding to obtain a new house in London . Although retaining a personal bedroom and study at Queen Square , he relocated his family to Horrington House in Turnham Green Road , West London , in January 1873 . This allowed him to be far closer to the home of Burne @-@ Jones , with the duo meeting on almost every Sunday morning for the rest of Morris ' life ."

    "text": "The following equation represents covered interest rate parity , a condition under which investors eliminate exposure to foreign exchange risk ( unanticipated changes in exchange rates ) with the use of a forward contract – the exchange rate risk is effectively covered . Under this condition , a domestic investor would earn equal returns from investing in domestic assets or converting currency at the spot exchange rate , investing in foreign currency assets in a country with a different interest rate , and exchanging the foreign currency for domestic currency at the negotiated forward exchange rate . Investors will be indifferent to the interest rates on deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate . The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits , 1 + id , is equal to the return on foreign deposits , [ S / F ] ( 1 + if ) . If these two returns weren 't equalized by the use of a forward contract , there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which , for example , an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate , convert to the foreign currency at today 's spot exchange rate , and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate ."

    "text": "After a period of leave in England over winter 1805 – 6 and promotion to colonel on 29 October 1805 , Brock returned to Canada to find himself temporarily in command of the entire British army there . By 1806 the United States was becoming increasingly hostile to the British Empire ; relations between the two nations continued to deteriorate until war finally broke out in 1812 . This hostility emerged from three sources : grievances at British violations of American sovereignty , restriction of American trade by Britain , and an American desire to gain territory by invading and annexing the poorly defended British North American colonies . American grievances included the impressment of American sailors by the Royal Navy , the blockade of French ports , and a belief that the British were inciting American Indians to attack U.S. settlements on the western frontier . War hawks in the U.S. called for an invasion of Canada to punish the British Empire and to lessen the threat to American interests represented by the Native Americans . At the same time the American states were becoming crowded and there was a growing attitude — later described by the phrase Manifest Destiny — that the United States was destined to control all of the North American continent . American hawks assumed that Canadian colonists would rise up and support the invading U.S. armies as liberators and that , as Thomas Jefferson famously wrote , conquering Canada would be \" a mere matter of marching \" . In response to this emerging threat Brock moved quickly to bolster Canadian defences . He strengthened the fortifications of Quebec by building walls and an elevated battery . Despite having little formal education Brock succeeded in creating a formidable defensive position largely due to his reading , which included several volumes on the science of running and setting up artillery . He also rearranged and strengthened the Provincial Marine ( responsible for transport on the lakes and rivers ) , which led to the development of a naval force capable of holding the Great Lakes . This was to be pivotal during the war . Nevertheless , Brock 's appropriation of civilian lands and labour for military use brought him into conflict with the civilian authorities led by Thomas Dunn ."

However , there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing . According to John C.

Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work .

    "text": "Historically , there has been uncertainty as to whether the European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B. phalloides . The taxon has been described as both a variety ( as B. phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916 ) and as a form ( as B. phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004 ) . In 1995 , mycologist Roy Watling opined that B. stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange @-@ tawny , slightly larger ( 5 – 6 @.@ 5 by 5 @.@ 75 – 7 µm , as opposed to 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 25 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 75 µm ) , and less ornamented . Further , B. stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size , a more coarsely scaly stipe , and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem . The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species . In 1904 , Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species ; in 1942 , Paul Marshall Rea , after studying 25 specimens from southern California , concluded that B. stevenii was conspecific with B. phalloides and represented a single species . An analysis of a number of European specimens — using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA — also suggested both to be conspecific . The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species ; they did , however , note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion . The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field @-@ collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world . They found that material labeled B. stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes , while that labeled B. phalloides was generally more consistent , and smaller . However , the B. phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK , while the B. stevenii material originated from a wide variety of locales and habitats , suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology . Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two , and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA . In 2006 , however , based on a study of specimens collected in China , other scientists considered them to be independent species ."

Firstly , when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke ; secondly , when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision @-@ making ; or , thirdly , when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer .

He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act , then the proposal is not coercive . However , if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors , then it is tricky to determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced .

The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social , perceptual , cognitive , and linguistic cues . While a range of cues are available from the start of word learning , it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process . While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues , older , more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues . For instance , young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience , but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping . Therefore , this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning , but the use of a wide range of cues develops over time ."

The high population density of the Mersey Basin has , historically , placed heavy demands on sewage treatment and disposal . Industrial and agricultural discharges into the Irwell , Medlock , and Irk rivers are responsible for a number of industrial contaminants found in the canal . Matters have improved since 1990 , when the National Rivers Authority found the area between Trafford Road Bridge and Mode Wheel Locks to be \" grossly polluted \" . The water was depleted of dissolved oxygen , which in the latter half of the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the turning basin in what is now Salford Quays rising to the surface during the summer months , giving the impression of solid ground . Previously , only roach and sticklebacks could be found in the canal 's upper levels , and then only during the colder parts of the year , but an oxygenation project implemented at Salford Quays from 2001 , together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the Mersey 's tributaries , has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream . The canal 's water quality remains low , with mercury and cadmium in particular present at \" extremely high levels \" . Episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife , although in 2005 , for the first time in living memory , salmon were observed breeding in the River Goyt ( a part of the Mersey 's catchment ) .

They are interrupted by the local augur , Lucius Petrus Dextrus , who has arrived to collect a sculpture he commissioned . The Doctor is intrigued by the sculpture , which resembles a segment of an oversized circuit board . Lucius Petrus reveals that he also has powerful ESP and calls out the name of the Doctor 's home planet , Gallifrey . The Doctor wishes to learn more about the sculptures and enlists Caecilius 's son Quintus to help him break into Lucius Petrus ' house . Inside , the Doctor deduces that the circuits will make an energy converter , but he is caught by Lucius Petrus . The two escape , but Lucius Petrus beckons a large stone creature to attack and kill them . The stone creature appears in Caecilius 's house and attacks them , but Quintus saves them by dousing the creature in water and killing it . In the confusion , the Sisterhood kidnap Donna , and the Doctor sets off to rescue her . He meets the high priestess of the Sisterhood , who is revealed to be transforming into a stone creature . The Doctor discovers that they are being controlled by the Pyroviles , volcanic creatures whose home planet of Pyrovilia was lost ( see Story arcs in Doctor Who # Medusa Cascade ) .

    "text": "Northallerton School 's roots can be traced as far back as 1322 . Originally sited near the Parish Church , its initial role was to train boys in grammar and song . The school flourished in the 17th century under the mastership of Thomas Smelt , and notable alumni of that period include theologian George Hickes , historiographer royal Thomas Rymer , John Radcliffe , doctor to King William of Orange and theologian Thomas Burnet . The school struggled in the 19th century and almost closed at the start of the 20th century with the number of pupils in single figures . However following the 1902 Education Act the North Riding Education Committee resolved to build and restructure the grammar school . To that end a new school was built near the Thirsk Road , which opened in 1909 with 104 pupils , half of whom were girls , the first time that they had been admitted . The school expanded throughout the 20th century . Following the 1944 Education Act , the school entry was based on the Eleven plus exam with all fees and charges being abolished . In 1973 the grammar school merged with the Secondary Modern Allertonshire School , which opened in 1941 , with the Allertonshire taking pupils aged 11 – 14 and the grammar school ages 14 – 18 . By 1976 the comprehensive system was adopted and in 1994 the grammar school was renamed Northallerton College to better reflect the school 's role in the community . In 2015 Northallerton College merged with Allertonshire School to become a full secondary school , and continues to operate over both former school sites ."

During December 6 , the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03P and initiated advisories , while the system was located on the 180th meridian about 180 km ( 110 mi ) southeast of Funafuti , Tuvalu . Over the next couple of days , the system slowly deepened as it organised further and caused gale to storm force winds on the island of Niulakita and strong squally winds over the rest of Tuvalu . During December 7 , the Fiji Meteorological Service ( FMS ) reported that the depression had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Joni . After it had been named the system passed near Niulakita as it was steered towards the southwest by a low to mid level flow and intensified further ."

It is a leading cause of blindness in dogs , and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye . If the fluid is not reduced , the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve . Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough , or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation . The sudden , rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow / closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma . Symptoms can include redness in the eye , the eye itself looking cloudy , sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye , or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful . Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually ."

He was the first to use both the binomial name Ailurus fulgens and the vernacular name panda in his description of the species published in 1825 in Histoire naturelle des mammifères . Ailurus is adopted from the ancient Greek word αἴλουρος ( ailouros ) , meaning \" cat \" . The specific epithet fulgens is Latin for \" shining , bright \" . Panda is the French name for the Roman goddess of peace and travellers , who was called upon before starting a difficult journey . Whether this is the origin of the French vernacular name panda remains uncertain . Later publications claim the name was adopted from a Himalayan language ."

However , a late fightback averted the unwanted record . Laker and Bedser , both from Surrey , joined forces and scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes .

At first , Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership between the two bowlers from Surrey — it was thought the Australian captain may have been happy for England to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards the end of the afternoon , but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable . O 'Reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in Surrey — The Oval — had a reputation for being batsman @-@ friendly , and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had the benefit of consistently favourable conditions , then they should also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with the willow .

The first of these large tower keeps were built in the north of England during the 14th century , at locations such as Warkworth . They were probably partially inspired by designs in France , but they also reflected the improvements in the security along the Scottish border during the period , and the regional rise of major noble families such as the Percies and the Nevilles , whose wealth encouraged a surge in castle building at the end of the 14th century . New castles at Raby , Bolton , and Warkworth Castle took the quadrangular castle styles of the south and combined them with exceptionally large tower keeps to form a distinctive , northern style . Built by major noble houses , these castles were typically even more opulent than the smaller castles like Nunney , built by the nouveau riche . They marked what historian Anthony Emery has described as a \" ... second peak of castle building in England and Wales , \" following on from the Edwardian designs at the end of the 14th century ."

    "text": "Monsoons are caused by the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle of land temperature compared to that of nearby oceans . This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a \" mixed layer \" that may be fifty meters deep , through the action of wind and buoyancy @-@ generated turbulence , whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly , with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so . Additionally , the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land . Together , these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land , with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean . The hot air over the land tends to rise , creating an area of low pressure . This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land , bringing the moist near @-@ surface air over the oceans with it . Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains , surface heating , convergence at the surface , divergence aloft , or from storm @-@ produced outflows at the surface .

He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself . This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante 's Convivio . Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus . Unlike Homer 's hero , Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world . Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels . Through these travels , mankind is able to have faith in salvation and able to see that there is more to the world than darkness . Eliot explains within the poem that we are all interconnected through time and that we must realize this . Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe . This , in turn , would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time . As Russel Kirk explains : \" That end , for those who apprehend a reality superior to ' birth , copulation , and death ' — a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature — is to know God and enjoy Him forever . \""

This awareness was partially due to difficulties encountered in obtaining heritage breeds for living history sites . This was particularly evident when historians were searching for historically authentic breeds to display at the Old Sturbridge Village in Massachusetts and were unable to find sheep of the Vermont strain of Merino , as they had gone extinct . As a result , these historians and others decided to attempt preservation of other rare breeds facing extinction . On March 16 , 1977 , the American Minor Breeds Conservancy was incorporated in Vermont . It was the first United States organization focused on preserving rare breeds of livestock and promoting genetic diversity among livestock breeds , and remains the preeminent organization in this field in the United States . A similar organization in Great Britain , the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , had been formed in 1973 . The organization conducted its first comprehensive survey of American livestock breeds in 1985 . Since then , the survey has been repeated every five years , with the status of endangered breeds being monitored in between . The initial survey was called \" the most comprehensive assessment of livestock genetic resources ever conducted in the United States \" . In 1986 , a fellow organization , Rare Breeds Canada , was formed , and the two bodies have worked together closely to preserve and promote breeds that have populations in the US and Canada . In 1993 , the organization changed its name to the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy ( ALBC ) . In 2013 , the organization again shortened its name to \" The Livestock Conservancy \" ."

John was made Count of Mortain , was married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester , and was given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall , Derby , Devon , Dorset , Nottingham and Somerset , all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade . Richard retained royal control of key castles in these counties , thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power , and , for the time being , the king named the four @-@ year @-@ old Arthur of Brittany as the heir to the throne . In return , John promised not to visit England for the next three years , thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant without fear of John seizing power . Richard left political authority in England – the post of justiciar – jointly in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville , and made William Longchamp , the Bishop of Ely , his chancellor . Mandeville immediately died , and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset , which would prove to be a less than satisfactory partnership .

    "text": "The Second Symphony , and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed , were composed during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski 's life . His mother died in 1967 , and the period 1967 – 70 saw a great deal of unrest in Poland . This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady , which sparked a summer of protests ; later , in 1968 , the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia 's Prague Spring , and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970 — which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities , both caused significant political and social tension in Poland . Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime , and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work , particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968 – 70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society . Indeed , Rostropovich 's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head ( he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn ) . Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music , although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree . In any case , the Cello Concerto was a great success , earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades .

He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore 's immigration laws were similar to those in the UK . In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason ; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay , and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay , for a day longer than the permitted period ; and that an alien 's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply . Furthermore , in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien 's permit to stay \" is revoked before the time limit expires , he ought ... to be given the opportunity of making representations : for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time \" . This argument was advanced by Siah 's counsel to persuade the court that \" an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and , therefore , he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure , if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely \" . The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an \" attractive \" one . However , he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had \" not been supported by any English authority \" , and that the position in Singapore is \" quite different \" . He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act , and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal . The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act ."

Their calculations suggested that the amount of heat generated for an Io with a homogeneous interior would be three times greater than the amount of heat generated by radioactive isotope decay alone .

Leuchter , who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings . Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings . Leuchter 's negative control , a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building , had no cyanide residue . In 1999 , James Roth , the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter 's samples , stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks , and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface . The surface that had been exposed to the chemical was not identified , and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount . In 1994 , the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re @-@ examined Leuchter 's claim , stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction . Using microdiffusion techniques , they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers ( as positive controls ) and living quarters ( as negative controls ) .

    "text": "The Nuova Cronica by Villani stands as a milestone achievement in the history of European chronicles . Mark Phillips writes that Villani 's account provided the basis for the historical works of Leonardo Bruni and Niccolò Machiavelli . Villani 's extensive work has also allowed for greater study of his contemporary Dante Alighieri by modern historians . Yet the Nuova Cronica also has its limitations , mostly with relying on inaccurate accounts of eras preceding its compilation . Earlier chronicles , such as the Chronica de origine civitatis of 1231 , provided little substantive or factual material , relying instead on legendary accounts and not venturing to analyze their historicity or question their validity . The historian Nicolai Rubinstein called Villani 's chronicle a much more \" mature expression \" of validated Florentine history , yet Villani still relied on the Chronica de origine civitatis for covering events of Florence 's earliest history ; hence he adopted some of the highly questionable legendary accounts as true historical events . Although Villani 's work is most reliable when it comes to historical events that occurred within his lifetime , there are some factual errors even in the contemporary biographies he presented . Kenneth R. Bartlett writes that Villani 's interest and elaboration in economic details , statistical information , and political and psychological insight signifies him as a more modern late medieval chronicler of Europe . However , he adds that Villani 's reliance upon divine providence aligned him more with the medieval tradition of chroniclers than the more credible historians of the Renaissance ."

Tippett 's Child still speaks profoundly to us in our own deeply troubled time \" ."

Edward advanced through Lothian towards Edinburgh , but Robert the Bruce declined to meet him in battle , drawing Edward further into Scotland . Plans to resupply the campaign by sea failed , and the large army rapidly ran out of food . Edward was forced to retreat south of the border , pursued by Scottish raiding parties . Edward 's illegitimate son , Adam , died during the campaign , and the raiding parties almost captured Isabella , who was staying at Tynemouth and was forced to flee by sea . The King planned a fresh campaign , backed by a round of further taxes , but confidence in Edward 's Scottish policy was diminishing . Andrew Harclay , instrumental in securing Edward 's victories the previous year and recently made the Earl of Carlisle , independently negotiated a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce , proposing that Edward would recognise Robert as the King of Scotland and that , in return , Robert would cease to interfere in England .

Its purpose was to limit the inflow of the tide , and to control the outflow of the river . The works were not particularly successful , and negotiations were started with the Commissioners of the Wittersham Levels to divert the river through those levels . After initial reluctance , an agreement was reached in February 1631 . The western end of the levels , from Kent Wall to the Knelle Dam , was to be used as an \" indraught \" , essentially a holding reservoir for river water and some sea water , which would be released in a controlled way to scour the main channel . An embanked channel called the New Salt Channel was constructed across the levels between Kent Wall and a new sluice in the Wittersham Sea Wall . The river was flowing to the south of the Isle by 4 May 1635 , an on 4 October , the navigation was also routed along the new channel , reducing its length by 5 miles ( 8 km ) .

Although Gore frequently stated that he had \" no plans to run \" , he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run . This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary , An Inconvenient Truth . The director of the film , Davis Guggenheim , stated that after the release of the film , \" Everywhere I go with him , they treat him like a rock star . \" After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award , Donna Brazile ( Gore 's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign ) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars . During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony , Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the \" greening \" of the ceremony itself . Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president . However , background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage , implying that it was a rehearsed gag , which he later acknowledged . After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary , speculation increased about a possible presidential run . Gore 's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running , he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John Edwards . Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run . Gore , however , remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency ."

While Corgan knew many of the songs would be difficult or impossible to replicate from their recorded versions in concert ( in fact , some songs were drastically altered for live performance ) , he has explained the use of overdubbing by posing the question \" When you are faced with making a permanent recorded representation of a song , why not endow it with the grandest possible vision ? \" This use of multilayered sounds was inspired by Corgan 's love of 1970s arena rock bands Queen , Boston , and the Electric Light Orchestra , as well as shoegaze , a British alternative rock style of the late 1980s and early 1990s that relied on swirling layers of guitar noise for effect . Mellon Collie coproducer Alan Moulder was originally hired to mix Siamese Dream because Corgan was a fan of his work producing shoegaze bands such as My Bloody Valentine , Ride , and Slowdive ."

Even though the cathedral stood finished around 1300 , it took more than a century to build ; the associated cathedral school of Aarhus Katedralskole was already founded in 1195 and ranks as the 44th oldest school in the world . Another important and historic church in the inner city , is the Church of our Lady ( Vor Frue Kirke ) also from the 13th century in Romanesque and Gothic style . It is smaller and less impressive , but it was the first cathedral of Aarhus and founded on an even older church constructed in 1060 ; the oldest stone church in Scandinavia . Parts of this former church were excavated in the 1950s and can now be experienced as a crypt beneath the nave of Vor Frue Kirke .

The expansion identified on the trunk of \" Yuka \" and other specimens was suggested to function as a \" fur mitten \" ; the trunk tip was not covered in fur , but was used for foraging during winter , and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion . It was also suggested that the expansion could be used to melt snow if there was shortage of water to drink , as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal . As in reindeer and musk oxen , the haemoglobin of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold , with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing .

However , it was not described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck ( Tadorna ferruginea ) and falcated duck ( Anas falcata ) . Around 1913 , a pair was collected in Korea , and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist Nagamichi Kuroda . Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater 's suggested parents of the alleged hybrid . Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916 , and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan , Kuroda described this bird as Pseudotadorna cristata in 1917 . The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda 's collection . A member of the family Anatidae , this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda , but is now placed in the genus Tadorna , which includes six other species of Old World shelducks . The genus name Tadorna comes from the Celtic word tadorne and means \" pied waterfowl \" , essentially the same as the English \" shelduck \" . The specific epithet , cristata , comes from the Latin word for crested . The species ' common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck 's head . This species is also known as the Korean crested shelduck , Korean sheldrake , and Korean Mandarin ."

After the failed revolt in 1294 – 95 of Madog ap Llywelyn – who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document – and the rising of Llywelyn Bren ( 1316 ) , the next major uprising was that led by Owain Glyndŵr , against Henry IV of England . In 1404 , Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France , Spain and Scotland . Glyndŵr went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns , including Machynlleth . But the rebellion failed , and Owain went into hiding in 1412 ; peace was essentially restored in Wales by 1415 . Although the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for post @-@ conquest government of the Principality of north Wales from 1284 until 1536 , there was no formal Union until 1536 .

The song is not a cover of The Weather Girls song \" It 's Raining Men \" , composed by Paul Jabara and Paul Shaffer , however it is based on it with regard to its lyrical content and does sample it . Instrumentation consists of sirens and \" mind @-@ melting \" bass . The song is written in the key of B ♭ major and is set in simple time with a moderated hip @-@ hop groove , with a metronome of 80 beats per minute . \" Raining Men \" ' s composition was likened to the work of M.I.A. by Emily McKay for NME . Stacey Anderson for Spin commented on Minaj 's vocal stylizaion of the word \" really , \" writing that she projects the word as a \" breathless contortion into its own fully demented sideshow , \" with regard to the fast speed in which Minaj raps . James Reed for The Boston Globe described Minaj 's verse as a \" manic guest rhyme \" . Rihanna 's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of B ♭ 4 . According to Jon Pareles for The New York Times , the songs lyrics revolve around Rihanna and Minaj \" singing and rapping about an endless supply of available men . \" Lyrically , Kevin O 'Donnell of Spin described the song as Rihanna and Minaj 's own \" female empowerment anthem ."

It has been described as being \" as recognizable in gaming circles as the Super Mario Bros. theme or Sonic the Hedgehog 's title screen pop \" .

Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda , who \" resolved to extirpate all of [ Oswiu 's ] nation , from the highest to the lowest \" . Additionally , according to Bede , Oswiu 's son Ecgfrith was being held hostage \" at the court of Queen Cynwise , in the province of the Mercians \" — perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement .

The identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain , but possibly it was a tributary of the Humber . There is good reason to believe it may well have been the river now known as Cock Beck in the ancient kingdom of Elmet . The Cock Beck meanders its way through Pendas Fields , close to an ancient well known as Pen Well on the outskirts of Leeds , before eventually joining the River Wharfe . This same Cock Beck whilst in flood also played a significant role in the much later Battle of Towton in 1461 . Another possibility is the River Went ( a tributary of the River Don , situated to the north of modern @-@ day Doncaster ) . It may be that Penda 's army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability , which would help explain Oswiu 's victory over forces that were , according to Bede , much larger than his own ."

Upon becoming Empress , Shōshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script , causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men , far removed from the women 's quarters .

Political parties , notably the Dashnaktsutiun , wanted to influence the direction of the revolution towards greater democracy and to safeguard gains already achieved . The Dashnak contribution to the fight was mostly military , as it sent some of its well known fedayees to Iran after the guerrilla campaign in the Ottoman Empire ended with the rise of the Young Turks . A notable ARF member already in Iran was Yeprem Khan , who had established a branch of the party in the country . Yeprem Khan was highly instrumental in the Constitutional revolution of Iran . After the Persian national parliament was shelled by the Russian Colonel Vladimir Liakhov , Yeprem Khan rallied with Sattar Khan and other revolutionary leaders in the Constitutional Revolution of Iran against Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar .

Nonetheless , the ARF came to collaborate with him and alongside Yeprem Khan posted many victories including the capture of Rasht in February 1909 . At the end of June 1909 , the fighters arrived in Tehran and after several battles , took over the Majles building and the Sepahsalar mosque . Yeprem Khan was then appointed chief of Tehran police .

Leissègues had reportedly issued orders for the squadron to sail for Jamaica , even though several of the French ships were not yet ready for sea , and two frigates were already under sail when the British arrived . Leissègues was not aboard Impérial ; he and a number of his officers were still conducting their business in the town and were therefore forced to join the squadron in small boats , which delayed the squadron . Several officers , possibly including Leissègues , did not reach their ships until after the engagement had begun . Recognising that his enemy was in a vulnerable position , Duckworth raised all sail in an effort to close with the French . Leissègues too recognised the danger his ships were in and ordered them to raise anchor and then to sail westwards along the coast in the direction of Nizao . [ Note A ] Maintaining close formation , the French formed a line of battle , Captain Pierre @-@ Elie Garreau in Alexandre leading , with Impérial , Diomède , Jupiter and Brave following . The frigates and corvette took a position between the battle line and the shore . Duckworth was concerned that there might be other French forces to the west . He therefore angled his line of attack to pass across the front of the French line and signaled to his squadron to direct their fire at the front three ships : Alexandre , Impérial and Diomède ."

The addition of up to 5 % oxygen ( like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above ) can be helpful in welding stainless steel , however , in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred .

Excessive oxygen , especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed , can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone . Argon @-@ helium mixtures are extremely inert , and can be used on nonferrous materials . A helium concentration of 50 – 75 % raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc , due to helium 's higher ionization temperature . Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations ( up to about 5 % ) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces . In higher concentrations ( up to 25 % hydrogen ) , it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper .

    "text": "This form of protective mimicry occurs in the genus Passiflora . The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals — however some Heliconius butterfly larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins , allowing them to specialize on this genus . This has created further selection pressure on the host plants , which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching . These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near each existing ones , which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival . Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic , meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals . Thus , it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies due to these grazing herbivore enemies . In addition , the decoy eggs are also nectaries , attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps . This acts as a further defense of the plant against the caterpillars ."

Meanwhile , on 2 August , a patrol from the 27th Infantry Battalion was sent out along the Ruri Bay Road in company with two tanks that were to act as their direct fire support . The Japanese were still active in the area , and had mined the road with a 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bomb that they had rigged to be detonated remotely . The Australian patrol accidentally triggered the device and the resulting explosion killed three men in one of the tanks and wounded eight infantrymen following behind . On 5 August , the Australians reoccupied the position at Base 5 after encountering only slight resistance and subsequently named it \" Part Ridge \" . After exploiting the position , it was discovered that the Japanese had built between 43 and 60 bunkers in the area . The majority of these had been destroyed by artillery , though , and after the area had been thoroughly searched for Japanese stragglers , the Australian patrol was withdrawn from the ridge ."

Both sides took their case to the High Court , which ruled that the Conservators should have the river in February 1830 . A further series of legal actions followed , after which the canal company attempted to obtain a new act of parliament to obtain the Tone by compulsory purchase . The Conservators then decided to negotiate , and an act of parliament passed in July 1832 authorised the takeover ."

For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals , which generated publicity and royalties . In 1910 his music featured at two of the largest and most prestigious festivals , with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month . The leading British music critics of the time , J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian , were strong in their praise . The former wrote of the fantasia , \" The work is wonderful because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling .

The simplest form of earthen house is one or more stories tall , rectangular , and features a thatched roof with slightly overhanging eaves to direct rain away from the foundation and thereby prevent its erosion . Wealthier families replace the thatch with clay roofing tiles and construct a veranda on the west face of the building supported by four slender equidistant columns ; this design is even more effective at protecting the building 's foundations from the eroding effects of rainfall .

The girls met with artist manager Simon Fuller , who signed them with 19 Entertainment . The group considered a variety of record labels , and signed a deal with Virgin Records in July . The original mix of \" Wannabe \" was considered lacklustre by the label 's executives . Ashley Newton , who was in charge of A & R , sent the song to American producer Dave Way for remixing ; the result was not what the group had hoped to achieve . As Halliwell later described it , \" the result was bloody awful \" . She elaborated in her second autobiography , Just for the Record : \" Right at the beginning of the Spice Girls , [ ... ] Ashley Newton had tried to turn us into an R & B group .

Why Shakespeare 's Banquo is so different from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known , though critics have proposed several possible explanations . First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king 's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king , as well as the author 's desire to flatter a powerful patron . But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo 's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder . There was , however , a need to provide a dramatic contrast to Macbeth ; a role that many scholars argue is filled by Banquo . Similarly , when Jean de Schelandre wrote about Banquo in his Stuartide in 1611 , he also changed the character by portraying him as a noble and honourable man — the critic D. W. Maskell describes him as “ … Schelandre 's paragon of valour and virtue ” — probably for reasons similar to Shakespeare 's ."

The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land , with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations . Some farmers claimed that MIS were driving up prices in agricultural water markets . Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing shrinkage of towns or was , conversely , stimulating employment ."

The contracts were officially signed one year later on 3 July 2008 , after the creation of BVT Surface Fleet through the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Group 's VT Shipbuilding which was a requirement of the UK Government . At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £ 4,085m for two ships . The financial crisis led to a decision in December 2008 to slow production , delaying the first ship until May 2016 and the second by two years . This decision alone added £ 1,560m to the cost . By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £ 5,900m ; taking off the cost of capital led to a MPR10 Capital DEL baseline cost of £ 5,254m at this time . If the carriers had been abandoned in the 2010 SDSR then the MoD could have cancelled £ 1.5bn of planned spending on Queen Elizabeth and £ 1.3bn of planned spending on Prince of Wales , but the loss of VAT exemption meant that cancelling one or two carriers would have overall saved £ 989m and £ 2,098m respectively . These long term savings were less important than the short term costs , there would have been nearly an extra £ 1bn of expenditure on cancellation costs in the FY11 / 12 budget . In November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £ 6,200m and BAE agreeing to pay 50 % of any cost overruns rather than 10 % as previously ."

And : \" All who have killed or witnessed the killing of the puma — and I have questioned scores of hunters on this point — agree that it resigns itself in this unresisting , pathetic manner to death at the hands of man . Claudio Gay , in his Natural History of Chili , says , \" When attacked by man its energy and daring at once forsake it , and it becomes a weak , inoffensive animal , and trembling , and uttering piteous moans , and shedding abundant tears , it seems to implore compassion from a generous enemy \" . Hudson adds that , except in relation to man , the puma is a ferocious animal , attacking even the much stronger jaguar ."

    "text": "Medieval society was highly stratified . In a time when famine was commonplace and social hierarchies were often brutally enforced , food was an important marker of social status in a way that has no equivalent today in most developed countries . According to the ideological norm , society consisted of the three estates of the realm : commoners , that is , the working classes — by far the largest group ; the clergy , and the nobility . The relationship between the classes was strictly hierarchical , with the nobility and clergy claiming worldly and spiritual overlordship over commoners . Within the nobility and clergy there were also a number of ranks ranging from kings and popes to dukes , bishops and their subordinates , such as priests . One was expected to remain in one 's social class and to respect the authority of the ruling classes . Political power was displayed not just by rule , but also by displaying wealth . Nobles dined on fresh game seasoned with exotic spices , and displayed refined table manners ; rough laborers could make do with coarse barley bread , salt pork and beans and were not expected to display etiquette . Even dietary recommendations were different : the diet of the upper classes was considered to be as much a requirement of their refined physical constitution as a sign of economic reality . The digestive system of a lord was held to be more discriminating than that of his rustic subordinates and demanded finer foods ."

However , water may need to be temporarily limited in quantity when a horse is very hot after a heavy workout . As long as a hot horse continues to work , it can drink its fill at periodic intervals , provided that common sense is used and that an overheated horse is not forced to drink from extremely cold water sources . But when the workout is over , a horse needs to be cooled out and walked for 30 – 90 minutes before it can be allowed all the water it wants at one time . However , dehydration is also a concern , so some water needs to be offered during the cooling off process . A hot horse will properly rehydrate while cooling off if offered a few swallows of water every three to five minutes while being walked . Sometimes the thirst mechanism does not immediately kick in following a heavy workout , which is another reason to offer periodic refills of water throughout the cooling down period ."

During Beorhtwulf 's reign and thereafter , the kingdom of Wessex had more influence than Mercia with the Archbishop of Canterbury . A charter of 840 provides evidence of a different kind concerning Beorhtwulf 's relations with the church . The charter concerns lands that had originally been granted by Offa to the monastery of Bredon in Worcestershire . The lands had come under the control of the church in Worcester , but Beorhtwulf had seized the land again . In the charter Beorhtwulf acknowledges the church 's right to the land , but forces a handsome gift from the bishop in return : \" four very choice horses and a ring of 30 mancuses and a skilfully wrought dish of three pounds , and two silver horns of four pounds ... [ and ] ... two good horses and two goblets of two pounds and one gilded cup of two pounds . \" This is not an isolated case ; there are other charters that show Mercian kings of the time disputing property with the church , such as a charter of 849 in which Beorhtwulf received a lease on land from the bishop of Worcester , and promised in return that he would be \" more firmly the friend of the bishop and his community \" and , in the words of historian Patrick Wormald , \" would not rob them in future \" . Wormald suggests that this ruthless behaviour may be explained by the fact that landed estates were becoming harder to find , as so much land had been granted to monasteries . The problem had been mentioned over a century before by Bede , who in a letter to Egbert , the Archbishop of York , had complained of \" a complete lack of places where the sons of nobles and of veteran thegns can receive an estate \" . Beorhtwulf 's concession of wrongdoing suggests that he could not rely on his nobles to support him in such a disagreement , and may indicate that his hold on the throne was insecure ."

Music critics , fans , and counterparts alike have considered Smith to be one of the best and most underrated female vocalists in country music history . Music critics have often compared Smith 's vocals to that of country legend Patsy Cline , due to her emotional delivery and her strong use of diction and phrasing . In his review of Smith 's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith , Jurek explained why Smith 's vocals are usually compared to Cline 's , \" Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline 's throne . It 's not that there aren 't many amazing vocalists in the field , and plenty of legends among them . But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction , Smith is it . \" Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists . Chely Wright said that she spent most of her childhood listening to records by Smith . George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography . Elvis Presley had many of Smith 's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith 's version of \" The Wonders You Perform \" , but never got around to doing so . In a discussion with country songwriter Fred Foster , Dolly Parton famously said , \" You know , there 's really only three female singers in the world : Barbra Streisand , Linda Ronstadt , and Connie Smith .

Franchisees sued the parent company claiming that it did not have the authority to dictate pricing structures for the independently held franchises . The court dismissed the case in a decision that stated the company could legally dictate pricing structures over its franchises objections , but found that there was enough evidence to allow the franchises to move forward with their claims of dealing in bad faith in a separate case . In response to the decision , the franchise group filed a second suit that claimed the deal was not properly structured and was implemented without the franchises ' consent . The NFA suit claimed BK acted in bad faith by implementing the deal after the franchises had twice voted down the deal ."

    "text": "Aquinas supported Augustine 's view that evil is a privation of goodness , maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good . The existence of this evil , Aquinas believed , can be completely explained by free will . Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will , he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world , and so individuals are responsible for their sin . Good is the cause of evil , but only owing to fault on the part of the agent . In his theodicy , to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God 's creation , because God 's creation lacked nothing . Aquinas noted that , although goodness makes evil possible , it does not necessitate evil . This means that God ( who is good ) is not cast as the cause of evil , because evil arises out of a defect in an agent , and God is seen to be without defect . Philosopher Eleonore Stump , considering Aquinas ' commentary on the Book of Job , argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering : it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil . Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it , and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur . Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil , Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen , rather than willing it . He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil , but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality . Like Augustine , Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will ."

Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural predators , including cats and rats . This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations . When the chemical cues responsible for the fear response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine , two homologous protein signals were identified : Fel d 4 ( Felis domesticus allergen 4 ) , the product of the cat Mup gene , and Rat n 1 ( Rattus norvegicus allergen 1 ) , the product of the rat Mup13 gene . Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria , but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats , demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour . It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours , but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice . This implies the mouse perceives them differently , via distinct neural circuits . The pheromone receptors responsible for Mup detection are also unknown , though they are thought be members of the V2R receptor class ."

A second , smaller skull soon was discovered as well . These skulls showed that the North American pterosaurs were different from any European species , in that they lacked teeth . Marsh recognized this major difference , describing the specimens as \" distinguished from all previously known genera of the order Pterosauria by the entire absence of teeth . \" Marsh recognized that this characteristic warranted a new genus , and he coined the name Pteranodon ( \" wing without tooth \" ) in 1876 . Marsh also reclassified all the previously named North American species from Pterodactylus to Pteranodon , with the larger skull , YPM 1117 , referred to the new species Pteranodon longiceps .

The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers . Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry , in accordance with local Islamic doctrine . However , the butterfly theme is a common exception ."

Privately , he lived an austere life , refusing to drink alcohol or smoke , and even as President made his own bed . Renowned for his mischievous sense of humour , he was known for being both stubborn and loyal , and at times exhibited a quick temper . He was typically friendly and welcoming , and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone , including his opponents . Constantly polite and courteous , he was attentive to all , irrespective of their age or status , and often talked to children or servants . He was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities . In later life , he always looked for the best in people , even defending political opponents to his allies , who sometimes thought him too trusting of others . He was raised in the Methodist denomination of Christianity , with the Methodist Church of Southern Africa claiming that he retained his allegiance to them throughout his life . An analysis of his writings have led to him being described by theologian Dion Forster as a Christian humanist , who relied more upon Ubuntu than Christian theology . According to Sampson , Mandela however never had \" a strong religious faith \" , while Boehmer stated that Mandela 's religious belief was \" never robust \" . He was fond of Indian cuisine , and had a lifelong interest in archaeology and boxing ."

    "text": "In the early years of using the technique , it was understood that it depended on the atmospheric 14C / 12C ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years . To verify the accuracy of the method , several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested ; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects . Over time , however , discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts . Neither the pre @-@ existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate , but a third possibility was that the 14C / 12C ratio had changed over time . The question was resolved by the study of tree rings : comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a continuous sequence of tree @-@ ring data that spanned 8 @,@ 000 years . ( Since that time the tree @-@ ring data series has been extended to 13 @,@ 900 years . ) In the 1960s , Hans Suess was able to use the tree @-@ ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by Egyptologists . This was possible because although annual plants , such as corn , have a 14C / 12C ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing , trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year , while the inner tree rings don 't get their 14C replenished and instead start losing 14C through decay . Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric 14C / 12C ratio of the year it grew in . Carbon @-@ dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric 14C / 12C ratio : with a sample of known date , and a measurement of the value of N ( the number of atoms of 14C remaining in the sample ) , the carbon @-@ dating equation allows the calculation of N0 – the number of atoms of 14C in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the 14C / 12C ratio in the atmosphere at that time . Armed with the results of carbon @-@ dating the tree rings , it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the 14C / 12C ratio . These curves are described in more detail below ."

As it was the first open world game developed by Insomniac they had to deploy new design and development skills to produce it . The time and resources needed to develop the game also expanded significantly . While developing the game 's world , the team broke it down into 10 to 11 hexes and zones . They are classified into three different types : low resolution zones , shadow zones , and mission zones , and they overlap each other so that they can keep all zones loaded at the same time . Sunset City had three different iterations . In the early stages , it was called Greenlight City , based on Burbank , California . This version of the city featured interior structures that could be explored by players , and existed when the game 's core concept revolved around \" scavenge , craft , defend \" . This city was replaced with \" Razor City \" when skateboarding , which later became oil slicks and trampolines , was introduced to the game . Razor City was \" Neo @-@ Tokyo \" -styled , but was later replaced by Sunset City which was more organized . While designing the game 's artificial intelligence , the team thought that the game 's enemies must force players to use the traversal system while simultaneously engaging in combat with them . Because of the game 's vertical design , the enemies were designed to adopt the game 's vertical map @-@ design . The team also developed a “ nav position tracker ” , which programmed these enemies to detect the location of players and find an ambush point ."

The most commonly seen genjutsu in the series is the simple creation of phantasms – causing the targeted person ( s ) to hear , see , smell , taste or feel sensations that are not actually there in order to manipulate them . Most genjutsu affects the five senses , though other applications of genjutsu exist . Those under the influence of genjutsu usually freeze in place or lose consciousness , depending on how capable they are in recognizing and defending against it . Depending on the purpose of the genjutsu , one could be running or jumping while under the genjutsu ( as seen when Itachi uses genjutsu on Naruto in part II , when he used the Rasengan on Itachi , only to find out it had been genjutsu and he had used it on air ) . A genjutsu can be broken in one of three ways . The first is \" genjutsu cancel \" ( 幻術解 , genjutsu kai ) , a disruption of the victim 's chakra flow either by themselves or their allies . Pain that is not a result of the genjutsu , such as stabbing oneself , is a second method of countering genjutsu .

Mack believes that this event was a turning point for Chloe 's maturity ; it is the moment that she realizes that there needs to be a line she should never cross . After it is revealed to Clark in the season five premiere that Chloe knows his secret , the character becomes a larger part of the storyline for the show . Knowing Clark 's secret allowed Chloe to finally come to terms with her feelings for Clark , and recognize where their relationship will always be ; Chloe 's acceptance of her place in Clark 's life provides a means for the two to have a more meaningful friendship , without the concerns of Chloe 's unrequited love . According to Mack , Chloe has learned to evolve her love for Clark into something more \" genuine \" and \" selfless \" ."

These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness , body size , and skull shape . The Queensland koala is the smallest of the three , with shorter , silver fur and a shorter skull . The Victorian koala is the largest , with shaggier , brown fur and a wider skull . The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders , and their status as subspecies is disputed . A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them , and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit . Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation . Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene . Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations .

Both sides were surprised , but the French and Indians quickly organized themselves and made a vicious onslaught against the British .

The discipline of the British regulars broke down , and a panicked retreat began , with the French and Indians firing at them from the cover of the surrounding woods . Braddock lost several horses , and eventually went down with a mortal wound . Washington was one of the few of Braddock 's aides to emerge relatively unscathed , despite being significantly involved in the fighting . He had two horses shot out from under him , and four bullets pierced his coat . He sustained no injuries and showed coolness under fire . Braddock , who had been loaded onto a wagon in a makeshift litter , ordered Washington to ride back to fetch the remainder of the army that was working its way up from the Great Meadows . The battered remnants of Braddock 's force eventually returned to Fort Cumberland , where Washington wrote letters harshly critical of the event .

He later joined the newly formed United States Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Forces and saw action in World War I , commanding the U.S. tank school in France before being wounded while leading tanks into combat near the end of the war . In the interwar period , Patton remained a central figure in the development of armored warfare doctrine in the U.S. Army , serving in numerous staff positions throughout the country . Rising through the ranks , he commanded the U.S. 2nd Armored Division at the time of the U.S. entry into World War II ."

The portrait was wreathed in bay . He requested recognition as heir to his father 's throne , and passed off responsibility for his unlawful ascension on his army , claiming they had \" forced it upon him \" . Galerius was put into a fury by the message ; he almost set the portrait on fire . His advisers calmed him , and argued that outright denial of Constantine 's claims would mean certain war . Galerius was compelled to compromise : he granted Constantine the title \" Caesar \" rather than \" Augustus \" ( the latter office went to Severus instead ) . Wishing to make it clear that he alone gave Constantine legitimacy , Galerius personally sent Constantine the emperor 's traditional purple robes . Constantine accepted the decision , knowing that it would remove doubts as to his legitimacy ."

    "text": "According to the musicologist John Tyrrell , Smetana 's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years , have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work , particularly in his native land . Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \" monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged \" by the Czech authorities , even as late as the last part of the 20th century . As a result , Tyrrell claims , a view of Czech music has been propagated that downplays the contributions of contemporaries and successors such as Dvořák , Janáček , Josef Suk and other , lesser known , composers . This is at odds with perceptions in the outside world , where Dvořák is far more frequently played and much better known .

Critic Joanna Levin defines a witch as a woman who succumbs to Satanic force , a lust for the devil , and who , either for this reason or the desire to obtain supernatural powers , invokes ( evil ) spirits .

Because no one else had published any other studies on the susceptibility of women , especially mothers , to becoming both the witch and the bewitched ( i.e. demonically possessed ) , Jorden 's findings helped create the foundation for the views popularized during the Renaissance about the relationship between women and witchcraft . Levin refers to Marianne Hester 's Lewd Women and Wicked Witches : A Study of Male Domination , in which Hester articulates a feminist interpretation of the witch as an empowered woman . Levin summarises the claim of feminist historians like Hester : the witch should be a figure celebrated for her nonconformity , defiance , and general sense of empowerment ; witches challenged patriarchal authority and hierarchy , specifically \" threatening hegemonic sex / gender systems . \" This view associates witchcraft — and by extension , Lady Macbeth — not with villainy and evil , but with heroism ."

The earliest settlements on the Adriatic shores were Etruscan , Illyrian , and Greek . By the 2nd century BC , the shores were under Rome 's control . In the Middle Ages , the Adriatic shores and the sea itself were controlled , to a varying extent , by a series of states — most notably the Byzantine Empire , the Serbian Empire , the Republic of Venice , the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire . The Napoleonic Wars resulted in the First French Empire gaining coastal control and the British effort to counter the French in the area , ultimately securing most of the eastern Adriatic shore and the Po Valley for Austria . Following Italian unification , the Kingdom of Italy started an eastward expansion that lasted until the 20th century . Following World War I and the collapse of Austria @-@ Hungary and the Ottoman Empire , the eastern coast 's control passed to Yugoslavia and Albania . The former disintegrated during the 1990s , resulting in four new states on the Adriatic coast . Italy and Yugoslavia agreed on their maritime boundaries by 1975 and this boundary is recognised by Yugoslavia 's successor states , but the maritime boundaries between Slovenian , Croatian , Bosnian – Herzegovinian and Montenegrin waters are still disputed .

It seems that the candidature of Bernard of Porto , recommended by Adrian as acceptable for both factions , had never been even advanced .

Then supporters of Rolando recognized that “ It seemed inappropriate that ... the apostolic see ... should remain any longer without a ruler because of the contentiousness of the aforesaid [ three ] men ” .

These cities were Miletus , Myus and Priene in Caria ; Ephesus , Colophon , Lebedos , Teos , Clazomenae , Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia ; and the islands of Samos and Chios . Although the Ionian cities were independent from each other , they acknowledged their shared heritage , and had a common temple and meeting place , the Panionion . They thus formed a ' cultural league ' , to which they would admit no other cities , or even other tribal Ionians . The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus , in around 560 BC . The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great ."

Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue . Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes . One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care .

    "text": "The influx of blacks into urban centers in the North and Midwest increased racial tensions in those cities . Between 1917 and 1923 , racial disturbances erupted in numerous cities throughout the U.S. , motivated by economic competition for industrial jobs , mostly between ethnic whites , immigrants and their descendants , and southern blacks , who were often used as strikebreakers . One of the first and most violent instances was a riot in East St. Louis , sparked in 1917 . In the Red Summer of 1919 , racially motivated mob violence erupted in 23 cities — including Chicago , Omaha , and Washington , D.C. — caused by competition for jobs and housing by returning World War I veterans of both races , and the arrival of waves of new European immigrants . Further unrest occurred in Tulsa in 1921 , when whites attacked the black Greenwood community . David Colburn distinguishes two types of violence against blacks up to 1923 : Northern violence was generally spontaneous mob action against entire communities . Southern violence , on the other hand , took the form of individual incidents of lynchings and other extrajudicial actions . The Rosewood massacre , according to Colburn , resembled violence more commonly perpetrated in the North in those years ."

Together with Gounod 's Faust and Bizet 's Carmen it became , and has remained , one of the cornerstones of the French operatic repertoire . After the intimate drama of Manon , Massenet once more turned to opera on the grand scale with Le Cid in 1885 , which marked his return to the Opéra . The Paris correspondent of The New York Times wrote that with this new work Massenet \" has resolutely declared himself a melodist of undoubted consistency and of remarkable inspiration . \" After these two triumphs , Massenet entered a period of mixed fortunes . He worked on Werther intermittently for several years , but it was rejected by the Opéra @-@ Comique as too gloomy . In 1887 he met the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson . He developed passionate feelings for her , which remained platonic , although it was widely believed in Paris that she was his mistress , as caricatures in the journals hinted with varying degrees of subtlety . For her , the composer revised Manon and wrote Esclarmonde ( 1889 ) . The latter was a success , but it was followed by Le mage ( 1891 ) , which failed . Massenet did not complete his next project , Amadis , and it was not until 1892 that he recovered his earlier successful form .

Although he was convinced that the Bible contained no blueprint for a certain form of government , Calvin favored a combination of democracy and aristocracy ( mixed government ) .

To further minimize the misuse of political power , Calvin proposed to divide it among several political institutions like the aristocracy , lower estates , or magistrates in a system of checks and balances ( separation of powers ) . Finally , Calvin taught that if rulers rise up against God they lose their divine right and must be put down .

The Plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill , and to end the secession , a Dictator named Quintus Hortensius was appointed . Hortensius , a Plebeian , passed a law called the \" Hortensian Law \" ( Lex Hortensia ) , which ended the requirement that an auctoritas patrum be passed before any bill could be considered by either the Plebeian Council or the Tribal Assembly . The requirement was not changed for the Centuriate Assembly . The importance of the Hortensian Law was in that it removed from the senate its final check over the Plebeian Council ( the principal popular assembly ) . It should therefore not be viewed as the final triumph of democracy over aristocracy , since , through the Tribunes , the senate could still control the Plebeian Council . Thus , the ultimate significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians .

To Fone , the poem was written by one who knew Byron and reveals Byron 's homosexuality . Fone also argues that the 1833 publication of the poem was prompted by the arrest of William Bankes , a homosexual friend of Byron , and the execution of Henry Nicholls for homosexual activity . The opening lines of the poem mention \" crippled Talleyrand \" , William Beckford and William Courtenay . Fone argues that the references to Beckford and Courtenay are used both to talk about the unfair treatment of homosexual men who had committed no real crime , and to emphasise England 's hypocrisy when it comes to sex . The poem then claims that England 's treatment of homosexuals forces Don Leon to travel to Greece in order to fulfill his desires and be free of intellectual control , which is fulfilled when Don Leon is able to be with Giraud . The fictional Giraud , according to Fone , allows Don Leon to break free of the homophobia of England . The poem , as he points out , tries to convince Moore to mention Byron 's homosexual desires . Fone concludes , \" It is not only the poem that is an effective attack on homophobic prejudice , but the example of the poet himself . \""

Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child 's repetition of the new word back to the adult . When a child begins to learn to read , their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same , as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms . These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3 . Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language , print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary .

In their 2006 examination of the specimen , Grellet @-@ Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg , or that the egg fragments had been associated with the Deinonychus skeleton by coincidence . They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod , noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones , making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal 's stomach . In addition , the manner in which the egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial , and was broken by the fossilization process . The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely ; the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated , but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life , indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation . The fact that these bones were belly ribs ( gastralia ) , which are very rarely found articulated , supported this interpretation . All the evidence , according to Grellet @-@ Tinner and Makovicky , indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the Deinonychus when it was buried . It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in Deinonychus similar to that seen in the related troodontids and oviraptorids , or that the egg was in fact inside the oviduct when the animal died ."

Featuring a classical production , the song emphasizes Gaga 's vocals , keeping focus on the lyrics : \" Til it happens to you / You don 't know how it feels , how it feels / Til it happens to you , you won 't know , it won 't be real / No , it won 't be real , won 't know how I feel . \" The lyrics ask those who tell victims how to cope , or pretend to understand their assault , to try to stand in their shoes . Gaga feels that some events need to be experienced in order to understand them . The first verse is sung by Gaga in a vulnerable voice , which gradually changes into an aggressive tone , which then changes to sound like that of a survivor during the final verses . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com , \" Til It Happens to You \" is set in the time signature common for a slow tempo of 59 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga 's vocals spanning from E3 to D5 . The song follows a basic sequence of Am – C – Fmaj7 – C – G / B as its chord progression ."

    "text": "By 1832 the amount spent on poor relief nationally had risen to £ 7 million a year , more than 10 shillings per head of population , up from £ 2 million in 1784 . The large number of those seeking assistance was pushing the system to \" the verge of collapse \" . The economic downturn following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century resulted in increasing numbers of unemployed . Coupled with developments in agriculture that meant less labour was needed on the land , along with three successive bad harvests beginning in 1828 and the Swing Riots of 1830 , reform was inevitable . Many suspected that the system of poor relief was being widely abused , and in 1832 the government established a Royal Commission to investigate and recommend how relief could best be given to the poor . The result was the establishment of a centralised Poor Law Commission in England and Wales under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 , also known as the New Poor Law , which discouraged the allocation of outdoor relief to the able @-@ bodied ; \" all cases were to be ' offered the house ' , and nothing else \" . Individual parishes were formed into Poor Law Unions , each of which was to have a union workhouse . More than 500 were built during the next 50 years , two @-@ thirds of them by 1840 . In certain parts of the country there was a good deal of resistance to these new buildings , some of it violent , particularly in the industrial north . Many workers lost their jobs during the major economic depression of 1837 , and there was a strong feeling that what the unemployed needed was not the workhouse but short @-@ term relief to tide them over . By 1838 , 573 Poor Law Unions had been formed in England and Wales , incorporating 13 @,@ 427 parishes , but it was not until 1868 that unions were established across the entire country , the same year that the New Poor Law was applied to the Gilbert Unions ."

There were numerous attempts to restore or rebuild castles so as to produce a consistently Gothic style , informed by genuine medieval details , a movement in which the architect Anthony Salvin was particularly prominent – as illustrated by his reworking of Alnwick and much of Windsor Castle .

    "text": "The choice of a shielding gas depends on several factors , most importantly the type of material being welded and the process variation being used . Pure inert gases such as argon and helium are only used for nonferrous welding ; with steel they do not provide adequate weld penetration ( argon ) or cause an erratic arc and encourage spatter ( with helium ) . Pure carbon dioxide , on the other hand , allows for deep penetration welds but encourages oxide formation , which adversely affect the mechanical properties of the weld. lts low cost makes it an attractive choice , but because of the reactivity of the arc plasma , spatter is unavoidable and welding thin materials is difficult . As a result , argon and carbon dioxide are frequently mixed in a 75 % / 25 % to 90 % / 10 % mixture . Generally , in short circuit GMAW , higher carbon dioxide content increases the weld heat and energy when all other weld parameters ( volts , current , electrode type and diameter ) are held the same . As the carbon dioxide content increases over 20 % , spray transfer GMAW becomes increasingly problematic , especially with smaller electrode diameters ."

Viewing all cowodi as cannibalistic predators , they killed rubber tappers around the turn of the 20th century and Shell Oil Company employees during the 1940s , in addition to any lowland Quechua or other outsiders who encroached on their land . Furthermore , they were prone to internal violence , often engaging in vengeance killing of other Huaorani .

While knowledge of early systems of law is limited , justice can be seen as developing from the twelfth century onwards with local sheriff , burgh , manorial and ecclesiastical courts and offices of the justicar to oversee administration .

By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of globular clusters around the galaxy 's center , he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the sun relative to the galactic center . While his distance estimate was in significant error , it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought . His error was because dust in the Milky Way diminished the amount of light from a globular cluster that reached the earth , thus making it appear farther away .

This has two elements : firstly , the breach of the duty of care must relate to the risk of death ( confirmed in R v Singh ) , and not to any lesser harm . In other words , the breach of the duty of care must cause the victim 's death . Secondly the breach of the duty of care must be so egregious as to amount to a crime . For example , on the fact of Adomako itself , the defendant , an anaesthetist , failed to spot a problem with the victim 's breathing tube for 11 minutes , something expert evidence suggested a competent anaesthetist would spot within thirty seconds or so .

Following a defeat at the hands of another branch of the Xianbei in 345 , the Yuwen split into three tribes , one of which was called the Kumo Xi . In 388 the Kumo Xi itself split , with one group remaining under the name Kumo Xi and the other group becoming the Khitans . This view is partially backed up by the Book of Wei , which describes the Khitans as being of Xianbei origins . There are also several competing theories on the origin of the Khitans . Beginning in the Song dynasty , some Chinese scholars suggested that the Khitans might have descended from the Xiongnu people . While modern historians have rejected the idea that the Khitan were solely Xiongnu in origin , there is some support for the claim that they are of mixed Xianbei and Xiongnu origin . Beginning with Rashid @-@ al @-@ Din Hamadani in the fourteenth century , several Western scholars have theorized that the Khitans were Mongolic in origin , and in the late 19th century Western scholars made the claim that the Khitans were Tungusic in origin — modern linguistic analysis has discredited this claim ."

    "text": "In Arnhem the Allied plan quickly unravelled . Only a small group of the 1st Parachute Brigade , mainly elements of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost 's 2nd Battalion , were able to reach the bridge . The 1st and 3rd Battalions were unable to penetrate the outer suburbs of the city and their advance stalled , so in order to support them the first lift of the South Staffords were sent forward on the morning of the 18th . When Cain arrived with the second lift they too were sent forward , arriving at the outskirts of Arnhem on the night of the 18th . Lieutenant Colonel David Dobie of the 1st Battalion proposed a concentrated attack on a narrow front between the Lower Rhine and the Arnhem railway line . The South Staffords would advance toward the bridge , with the remnants of the 1st and 3rd Battalions on their right flank , while the 11th Parachute Battalion , remained in reserve . The Staffords moved forward at 4.30am with D Company in the lead , followed by B and A Companies with C Company in reserve . In the area around St Elizabeth Hospital , the lead company met heavy resistance clearing houses and B Company took the lead , getting as far as a dell near the Arnhem City Museum . Here Cain and his men encountered enemy armour for the first time . The company was only armed with PIATs and mortars and although Cain and several of his company opened fire on the tanks and guns , they did not manage to disable any . By 11 : 30 they had run out of PIAT ammunition and the tanks now dominated the area . Their position was clearly hopeless and so Lieutenant Colonel McCardie , the commanding officer ( CO ) of 2nd Battalion , The South Staffordshire Regiment , ordered them to withdraw from the dell . Cain fell back with several of his men but few of them were able to escape , while the men of the other companies were forced to surrender in their droves . Cain was the only senior officer of the battalion to escape in what he later described as the \" South Staff 's Waterloo \" ."

To get a handle on how to portray Wood , Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz , and the acting of Mickey Rooney , Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem . He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood .

Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation ( by aerobic / anaerobic respiration or fermentation ) and biosynthetic reactions ( e.g. , carbon dioxide fixation ) , whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes . Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds as a source of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction . This reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise ATP and drive metabolism . In aerobic organisms , oxygen is used as the electron acceptor . In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds , such as nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors . This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification , sulfate reduction , and acetogenesis , respectively ."

In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary , Lord Russell , notified Bulloch , who had purchased the ships in his own name , that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war . Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863 , nominally on behalf of the Egyptian government , with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea . The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships , so this was superficially plausible . North Carolina , later HMS Scorpion , was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi , later HMS Wivern , received the name of El Monnassir . Lord Russel , prompted by the protests of the U.S. Ambassador , Charles F. Adams queried the Egyptian government directly and confirmed that this was merely a subterfuge to disguise the true ownership of the vessels . The Admiralty was prompted to send a guard ship , HMS Majestic , to watch over the newly launched El Toussan after Lairds had made a request to begin sea trials in September . The Liverpool Collector of Customs was instructed not to let the ship leave her graving dock under any circumstances and the Surveyor of Customs finally seized the ships on 9 October ."

Engineer England was found by a Select Committee to have overpaid the contractors and forced to resign . The water was captured at the weir , piped for storage to the Thorndon Park Reservoir then to a water tower at Kent Town . Water from Kent Town storage was distributed via a manually controlled water system , unmetered for its first six years . Within six years 20 @,@ 000 citizens in Adelaide and Port Adelaide were connected to reticulated water from the Torrens .

Beam of the Union 's 1st New Jersey Artillery , along with a few others , and several Federal batteries ( though none that were actually engaged ) had to move to avoid the fire . Although the barrage by Lee 's forces did claim a few lives , Union forces remained unfazed and continued their fearsome barrage . Indeed , Union Army Lt. Charles B. Haydon supposedly fell asleep during the artillery fight . On both the left and right flanks , several of the batteries that did engage lasted no more than minutes before being rendered incapable of fire . Moreover , in a failure of command that , according to historian Thomas M. Settles , must ultimately be placed on Lee 's shoulders , the movements of the two flanks were never coordinated with one another . D. H. Hill found the failure of the Confederate artillery discouraging and later dismissed the barrage as \" most farcical \" ."

It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz , country and new wave . It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar . According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic , the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of \" Somethin ' Stupid \" by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra ( 1967 ) . The lyrics are introspective , and portray the protagonist 's \" feigned nonchalance \" . Writing for Spin , editor J.D. opined that the song 's theme is \" literary reflections \" as Westerberg sings , \" Quttin ' school and goin ' to work and never goin ' fishin ' \" . According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone , the song 's theme is that \" life is a lilting series of ultimately empty , but nonetheless compulsory , soirees \" , while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is \" about loneliness and youthful insecurity \" . In an interview for the Los Angeles Times , Westerberg said : \" One of the reasons we used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage . That 's one of the things ' Swingin ' Party ' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put yourself on display all the time . \""

During the medieval period , the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin . The neck , specifically , was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will , connecting the reasoning part ( the head ) and the courageous part ( the heart ) . Gawain 's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage . By accepting the girdle from the lady , he employs reason to do something less than courageous — evade death in a dishonest way . Gawain 's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound . The Green Knight 's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along : the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain , rather than submitting his will in humility to God . The Green Knight , by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot , also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot , and therefore all of humanity . However , the wounds of Christ , believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies , are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful \" stiffneckedness \" will be healed among fallen mortals ."

Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three . A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong . If one person violates a law , perhaps everyone would — thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules . When someone does violate a law , it is morally wrong ; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones . Most active members of society remain at stage four , where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force ."

They were likely formed between 25 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 years ago when lava erupted beneath glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation . Their current structures are comparable to their original forms due to the minimal degree of erosion . As a result , the domes display the shapes and columnar joints typical of subglacial volcanoes . The random shapes of the Ember Ridge domes are the result of erupted lava taking advantage of former ice pockets , eruptions taking place on uneven surfaces , subsidence of the domes during volcanic activity to create rubble and separation of older columnar units during more recent eruptions . The northern dome , known as Ember Ridge North , covers the summit and eastern flank of the mountain ridge . It comprises at least one lava flow that reaches a thickness of 100 m ( 330 ft ) , as well as the thinnest columnar units in the Mount Cayley volcanic field . The small size of the columnar joints indicates that the erupted lava was cooled immediately and are mainly located on the dome 's summit . Ember Ridge Northeast , the smallest subglacial dome of Ember Ridge , comprises one lava flow that has a thickness no more than 40 m ( 130 ft ) . Ember Ridge Northwest , the most roughly circular subglacial dome , comprises at least one lava flow . Ember Ridge Southeast is the most complex of the Ember Ridge domes , consisting of a series of lava flows with a thickness of 60 m ( 200 ft ) .

The Freikorps were nationalistic organisations primarily composed of disaffected , disenchanted , and angry German combat veterans founded by the government in January 1919 to deal with the threat of a Communist revolution when it appeared that there was a lack of loyal troops . A very large number of the Freikorps believed that the November Revolution had betrayed them when Germany was alleged to be on the verge of victory in 1918 . Hence , the Freikorps were in opposition to the new Weimar Republic , which was born as a result of the November Revolution , and whose founders were contemptuously called \" November criminals \" . Captain Ernst Röhm of the Reichswehr served as the liaison with the Bavarian Freikorps . Röhm was given the nickname \" The Machine Gun King of Bavaria \" in the early 1920s , since he was responsible for storing and issuing illegal machine guns to the Bavarian Freikorps units . Röhm left the Reichswehr in 1923 and later became commander of the SA . During the 1920s and 1930s , the SA functioned as a private militia used by Hitler to intimidate rivals and disrupt the meetings of competing political parties , especially those of the Social Democrats and the Communists .

Therefore , secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style .

    "text": "According to Jains , the consequences of karma are inevitable . The consequences may take some time to take effect but the karma is never fruitless . The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise . A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects , as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions . However , those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately . It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions — like proper time , place , and environment — to arise for it to manifest and produce effects . If the supportive conditions do not arise , the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul . These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas , intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time , place , surroundings . There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas , according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred ."

    "text": "Two main theories have emerged to explain the formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans . The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming . The last stage of Jupiter 's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk ; during this growth , which lasted for only about 10 @,@ 000 years , the mass of Jupiter increased by a factor of ten . The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet . The capture mechanism was very efficient — about 50 % of all remaining planetesimals were trapped . This hypothesis has two major problems : the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude , and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model . However , simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for Saturn , and this has been borne out by observation : to date no trojans have been found near Saturn ."

All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty . They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container .

Their demonstrations quickly became intertwined with the activities of revolutionaries , who were seeking liberal political reforms and a constitutional monarchy for France . The market women and their various allies grew into a mob of thousands , and encouraged by revolutionary agitators , they ransacked the city armory for weapons and marched to the Palace of Versailles . The crowd besieged the palace , and in a dramatic and violent confrontation , they successfully pressed their demands upon King Louis XVI . The next day , the crowd compelled the king , his family , and most of the French Assembly to return with them to Paris ."

In a nonlinear device , two types of resistance can be defined : ' static ' or ' absolute resistance ' , the ratio of voltage to current <formula> , and differential resistance , the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current <formula> . The term negative resistance refers to negative differential resistance ( NDR ) , <formula> . In general , a negative differential resistance is a two @-@ terminal component which can amplify , converting DC power applied to its terminals to AC output power to amplify an AC signal applied to the same terminals . They are used in electronic oscillators and amplifiers , particularly at microwave frequencies . Most microwave energy is produced with negative differential resistance devices . They can also have hysteresis and be bistable , and so are used in switching and memory circuits . Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are tunnel diodes , Gunn diodes , and gas discharge tubes such as neon lamps . In addition , circuits containing amplifying devices such as transistors and op amps with positive feedback can have negative differential resistance . These are used in oscillators and active filters ."

A 2007 article in the Georgetown Law Review by Martin Hewett was critical of the decision . Hewett 's main criticism was based on the Court 's lack of a standard on which to evaluate whether certain evidence was \" material \" to a defendant 's case . Hewett noted that in a post @-@ Washington decision in 1973 , the Court applied a \" case @-@ specific \" decision rather than a \" general constitutional standard \" . This line of decisions , Hewett argued , led to a standard which allows a trial judge the authority to determine the \" actual reliability of the evidence \" in cases where a witness is not present . The \" newly @-@ seized power \" was limited to the cases at hand in a manner which suggested the ambiguous calculus the Court was using was flawed . This vagueness in the standard came from cases where the \" situations [ involved ] the reliability of the excluded evidence [ that ] could factfinder \" .

Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol , but the services were at regular intervals . Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase , and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted , which lost more passengers . A year later in 1963 , the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line , but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn . Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965 , and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line , including Shirehampton , with tickets issued by the train guard .
