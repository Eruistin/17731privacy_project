However , based on its physical similarity to the kestrels and the established nature of the name American kestrel , there has been little impetus to change its name . This could change in the future if continued genetic research more precisely determines the evolutionary history of the American kestrel within the genus falco . The entire genus is actually a set of species so closely related that most or all can be hybridized by artificial insemination . Significant natural hybridization of species has occurred in the past during the evolution of this closely related set of species , such that precise evolutionary genetic analysis as to which species are more basal to other species or to the genus as a whole is difficult to render ."

Nevertheless , his subordinates refused to play along and instead raced with one another to be the first to Nanking . Matsui revised his plans only upon discovering that his own armies were well ahead of their scheduled operational targets . It is again argued that Matsui was unable to restrain the men under his command , and that , since Matsui was an elderly general pulled from retirement , most of his younger and brasher subordinates had little respect for his orders and assumed that he would be back in the reserves and shortly out of their way . Matsui 's command problems were made further complicated by the fact that , between December 5 and December 15 , he was frequently bedridden due to bouts of malaria , which he had first shown symptoms of on November 4 . Though ill , he forced himself to press on with his duties , issuing orders from his sickbed . On December 7 he moved his command post from Shanghai to Suzhou in order to be closer to the frontlines , and on December 9 he ordered that a \" summons to surrender \" be dropped by airplane over Nanking . Because the Chinese Army defending Nanking did not respond , the next day Matsui approved an all @-@ out attack on the city . The CCAA suffered significant casualties fighting along the mountainous terrain just north of the city because Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there to prevent any damage from coming to its two famous historical sites , Sun Yat @-@ sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum . Although the Chinese garrison defending Nanking collapsed under pressure of the Japanese attack within a few days , instead of formally surrendering the Chinese soldiers simply threw away their uniforms and weapons and then merged with the city 's civilian population . The Japanese occupied Nanking on the night of December 12 / 13 . Japanese soldiers in the city then massacred prisoners of war and engaged in random acts of murder , looting , and rape which are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre ."

While there has been theological debate over his nature , Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father , and others considered him an aspect of the Father rather than a separate person . The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils , which established the Holy Trinity , with Jesus both fully human and fully God . Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos , God 's incarnation and God the Son , both fully divine and fully human . However , the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians . With the Protestant Reformation , Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus ' two natures . Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints , Unitarians and Jehovah 's Witnesses ."

In Haiti , the poorest country in the western hemisphere , over half the population lives on less than a dollar a day and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day . Severe poverty , compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child ’ s vulnerability to modern slavery . Factors that increase a child 's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents , lack of access to clean water , lack of educational opportunities , and having access to family in a city . In addition to poverty , individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment , illiteracy , poor educational opportunities , a history of physical or sexual abuse , homelessness , and drug abuse .

    "text": "Flerovium is a member of group 14 in the periodic table , below carbon , silicon , germanium , tin , and lead . Every previous group 14 element has four electrons in its valence shell , forming a valence electron configuration of ns2np2 . In flerovium 's case , the trend will be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p2 ; flerovium will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects . Differences are likely to arise ; a largely contributing effect is the spin – orbit ( SO ) interaction — the mutual interaction between the electrons ' motion and spin . It is especially strong for the superheavy elements , because their electrons move faster than in lighter atoms , at velocities comparable to the speed of light . In relation to flerovium atoms , it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels ( stabilizing the corresponding electrons ) , but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four . The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect , and the effect \" tearing \" the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting . Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second ( azimuthal ) quantum number l from 1 to 1 ⁄ 2 and 3 ⁄ 2 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell , respectively . For many theoretical purposes , the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s27p2"

This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult : a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good , yet also hold that God 's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness . This raises the problem of how ( and whether ) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all , which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life .

The game 's name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication , a similar approach taken by Myst ( 1993 ) . Blow attributes much of The Witness 's design to Myst , a game that got him into video game development . One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of \" pixel hunting \" in some of its puzzles ; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle . Within The Witness , Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion , using the maze panels as this mechanic . While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes , the rules and behavior described by the game 's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game . The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location , a means to \" [ cut ] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games \" . Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful within the context of the game , rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved , and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game ."

For example , the language of thought hypothesis has been accused of either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous . Specifically , Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT , this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned . If natural language learning requires some representational substrate ( the LOT ) in order for it to be learned , why shouldn 't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on , ad infinitum ? On the other hand , if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT , then why should it be required for the learning of natural languages ? In this case , the LOT would be superfluous . Fodor , in response , argues that the LOT is unique in that it does not have to be learned via an antecedent language because it is innate ."

In particular , the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region . The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West . Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied near the end of the Pinedale glaciation . Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal , followed by a cooler climate from about 1000 BC ."

This is portrayed by Major Colvin , imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims ."

However , the story and particularly the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic to Disney and his animators . Namely one of the troubles they encountered was that the original story lacked necessary interaction between the main protagonist , Gerda ( who later served as an inspiration for Anna ) , and the Snow Queen . Most obviously , Andersen 's version did not feature any confrontation between them : when brave little Gerda enters the Snow Queen 's ice castle and sheds her tears on Kay , the Snow Queen is nowhere to be seen . There just was not enough character conflict to form a full @-@ length feature . Later on , Glen Keane , Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi , Harvey Fierstein , Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz were among other Disney executives to make efforts towards translating this potential material to the big screen , but none of them made their way . Around 2008 , Chris Buck pitched Disney his version of The Snow Queen . At the time , the project was planned to be traditionally animated under the name of Anna and the Snow Queen . However , by early 2010 , the project encountered the same problem and was stuck again .

Stating that most of the score was written for piano , strings and harp , with solos for violin and cello , she called her score something of a \" chamber piece \" . \" If you use a solo instrument , it 's like having a voice \" , she says . \" It highlights the emotion . \" But , she adds , \" the violin is played with virtually no vibrato , because I didn 't ever want it to sound sentimental \" . She notes that \" for my own taste , I stay on the side of restraint , because I think it works better in film \" .

Romantic poems about tournaments and courtly love became popular in Paris and this fashion spread into England in the form of lays ; stories about the court of King Arthur were also fashionable , due in part to the interest of Henry II . English continued to be used on a modest scale to write local religious works and some poems in the north of England , but most major works were produced in Latin or French . In the reign of Richard II there was an upsurge in the use of Middle English in poetry , sometimes termed \" Ricardian poetry \" , although the works still emulated French fashions . The work of Geoffrey Chaucer from the 1370s onwards , however , culminating in the influential Canterbury Tales , was uniquely English in style . Major pieces of courtly poetry continued to be produced into the 15th century by Chaucher 's disciples , and Thomas Malory compiled the older Arthurian tales to produce Le Morte d 'Arthur ."

    "text": "A more recent preparation method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones for a complete skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs ( called a ROM , though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America ) . Alternatively , the entire bird ( or any soft parts associated with preparations described above ) may be preserved in alcohol . For any of these methods , several supplemental preparations may be made . For example , a wing may be removed and preserved separately as a spread wing for better study of flight feathers ; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses ; or a recording of the bird 's song before collection may be archived . Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected ( killed ) . Finally , if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved , as is the case with some salvaged specimens , the skeleton alone may be preserved . Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae ( genus Dermestes ) . Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects , specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high @-@ quality museum cases in a climate @-@ controlled room . Each specimen has data associated with it , and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen ’ s scientific value . Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information , such as the time and place the bird was found or collected . This and other important information , such as mass , sex , fat deposition , and degree of skull ossification , is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number . Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen , as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird .

Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study .

He conceded it to be an \" important , but not a great movie — or even a particularly good one , for that matter . \" For a casual movie goer , he stated , \" ' Korkoro ' feels like a slow burn , lagging on long after most of the audience has long since called it quits \" . In defence of the film 's incoherent narrative style , Jr Glenn Heath at Slant Magazine explained that Gatlif intended it less as a historical drama and more as evoking the sense of a memory , imbibing the stream of consciousness techniques . Commenting on its tone , he wrote that \" Korkoro is a reserved but lasting examination of collectively silent horror \" . At L 'Express , Sophie Benamon declared that with the film 's controlled pace , it keeps its viewers breathless and induces emotion . Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche stated that the film transcends the stereotypes while the reviewer at Arizona Reporter noted that some might consider it to be stereotyping the Romanies ."

Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the \" mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood \" . Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused . Tom Robinson 's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence , as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury 's decision . Furthermore , the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired , which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of , but also crippled him in other ways . Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as \" stupid , pathetic , defenseless , and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites , rather than his own intelligence to save him \" . Although Tom is spared from being lynched , he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison , shot seventeen times ."

When breeding , it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes .

Its breeding habitat is quite specific , and even near relatives do not share it ; for example , the willow warbler ( P. trochilus ) prefers younger trees , while the wood warbler ( P. sibilatrix ) prefers less undergrowth . In winter , the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub , and is not so dependent on trees . It is often found near water , unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats . There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas , especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London .

    "text": "Bach 's early cantatas are \" Choralkonzerte \" ( chorale concertos ) in the style of the 17th century , different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714 . Wolff points out the relation of Bach 's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude , with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck . Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale . Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met , Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region , and Bach 's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt . Another of Pachelbel 's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata , Nach dir , Herr , verlanget mich , BWV 150 , and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706 ."

Due to the script changes , large sections of dialogue needed to be re @-@ translated by Slattery and re @-@ recorded by the English actors due to lack of necessary emotional drive for the scenes .

    "text": "The modern understanding of planetary motion arose from the combined efforts of astronomer Tycho Brahe and physicist Johannes Kepler in the 16th century . Tycho is credited with extremely accurate measurements of planetary motions , from which Kepler was able to derive his laws of planetary motion . According to these laws , planets move on ellipses ( not epicycles ) about the Sun ( not the Earth ) . Kepler 's second and third laws make specific quantitative predictions : planets sweep out equal areas in equal time , and the square of their orbital periods equals a fixed constant times the cube of their semi @-@ major axis . Subsequent observations of the planetary orbits showed that the long axis of the ellipse ( the so @-@ called line of apsides ) rotates gradually with time ; this rotation is known as apsidal precession . The apses of an orbit are the points at which the orbiting body is closest or furthest away from the attracting center ; for planets orbiting the Sun , the apses correspond to the perihelion ( closest ) and aphelion ( furthest ) ."

For example , an evaluation of several leading alignment programs using the BAliBase benchmark found that at least 24 % of all pairs of aligned amino acids were incorrectly aligned . These errors can arise because of unique insertions into one or more regions of sequences , or through some more complex evolutionary process leading to proteins that do not align easily by sequence alone . As the number of sequence and their divergence increases many more errors will be made simply because of the heuristic nature of MSA algorithms . Multiple sequence alignment viewers enable alignments to be visually reviewed , often by inspecting the quality of alignment for annotated functional sites on two or more sequences . Many also enable the alignment to be edited to correct these ( usually minor ) errors , in order to obtain an optimal ' curated ' alignment suitable for use in phylogenetic analysis or comparative modeling ."

The Byzantinist and Arabist Irfan Shahîd , who argues in favor of Philip 's Christianity in Rome and the Arabs , assumes that he had been a Christian before becoming emperor . He argues , therefore , that there is no need to explain the absence of evidence for Philip 's conversion in contemporary Christian literature . Trachonitis , equidistant from Antioch in the north and Bosra in the south , and sited on a road connecting the two , could have been Christianized from either direction . Even if he was not himself Christian , Philip would probably have been familiar with Christians in his hometown as well as Bosra and other nearby settlements . Hans Pohlsander , a classicist and historian arguing against accounts of Philip 's Christianity , allows that Philip \" may have been curious about a religion which had its origins in an area so close to his place of birth . As an eastern provincial rather than an Italian , he may not have been so intense in his commitment to the traditional Roman religion that he could not keep an open mind on other religions . \" He also accepts that Philippopolis probably contained a Christian congregation during Philip 's childhood . For the scholar of religion Frank Trombley , however , the absence of evidence for the early Christianization of Philippopolis makes Shahîd 's assumption that Philip was Christian from early childhood unmerited ."

On 4 April 1952 , Green participated in a Lincoln sortie in place of an injured pilot . The first aircraft he took off in had to turn back owing to engine failure . The second completed the mission but was found to have lost brake power as it was returning to Tengah , and there was a danger of the aircraft overrunning the landing strip and sustaining heavy damage ; the crew was able to slow the Lincoln on the runway by trailing a parachute from the rear turret upon touching down ."

The most that can be said about built structures under Diocletian 's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier ( where he followed the works built under Probus along the Lake Constance @-@ Basel and the Rhine – Iller – Danube line ) , on the Danube- where a new line of forts on the far side of the river , the Ripa Sarmatica , was added to older , rehabilitated fortresses – in Egypt , and on the frontier with Persia . Beyond that , much discussion is speculative , and reliant on the broad generalizations of written sources . Diocletian and the tetrarchs had no consistent plan for frontier advancement , and records of raids and forts built across the frontier are likely to indicate only temporary claims . The Strata Diocletiana , built after the Persian Wars , which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of Bostra , is the classic Diocletianic frontier system , consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts – defensible hard @-@ points manned by small garrisons – followed by further fortifications in the rear . In an attempt to resolve the difficulty and slowness of transmitting orders to the frontier , the new capitals of the tetrarchic era were all much closer to the empire 's frontiers than Rome had been : Trier sat on the Rhine , Sirmium and Serdica were close to the Danube , Thessaloniki was on the route leading eastward , and Nicomedia and Antioch were important points in dealings with Persia ."

In General Trưởng 's view , the aforementioned generals were victims of injustice , as they were far more competent than Thiệu 's loyalists in Saigon . In addition to the military disasters suffered on the battlefield , President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu also caused instability within his own government during the final days of South Vietnam 's existence . For example , on April 2 , President Thiệu requested the country 's National Assembly to dissolve Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm 's cabinet , and replace him with Nguyễn Bá Cẩn . The National Assembly quickly approved President Thiệu 's request . Then on the same day , President Thiệu also ordered the arrest of seven individuals who had worked for Air @-@ Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ , believing they were plotting to overthrow him . William Colby — CIA Chief of Station in Saigon — wrote in a report back to Washington that the balance of power had leaned in Hanoi 's favour .

From Japan 's point of view the attack on Russia very nearly ruptured the Tripartite Pact on which the Empire was depending for Germany 's aid in maintaining good relations with Moscow so as to preclude any threat from Siberia . Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe felt betrayed because the Germans clearly trusted their Axis allies too little to warn them of Barbarossa , even though he had feared the worst since receiving an April report from Ōshima in Berlin that \" Germany is confident she can defeat Russia and she is preparing to fight at any moment . \" Foreign minister Matsuoka on the other hand vividly tried to convince the Emperor , the cabinet as well as the army staff of an immediate attack on the Soviet Union . However , his colleagues rejected any such proposal , even regarding him as \" Hitler 's office boy \" by now and pointed out to the fact that the Japanese army , with its light and medium tanks , had no intention of taking on Soviet tanks and aircraft until they could be certain that the Wehrmacht had smashed the Red Army to the brink of defeat ."

The most important of these symbols was the Christian cross , a widely used symbol of hope and suffering . The cross could take multiple forms , from Catholic designs in France , to Orthodox crosses in eastern Europe . Celtic crosses were popular in Britain and Ireland , partially because they avoided Catholic connotations , although they were considered vulgar by more classical architects such as Blomfield . In France , les croix des bois , wooden crosses , became popular symbols at memorials after Roland Dorgelès 's novel of the same name . German memorials made extensive use of the image of the Virgin Mary tending her son Christ , following in the tradition of the pietà . The crucifixion was also a widely used symbol , as seen in Derwent Wood 's Canada 's Golgotha , although Christ himself was relatively rarely typically seen on British memorials ."

According to oral history , the king attempted to purchase rice from his fief at Ambohipiainana . The town had a surplus but the local leader refused to sell rice to Andriamasinavalona , claiming none was available . The king then sent porters to purchase rice from Antsahatovoka , where the residents declared that while the land was his and it was thus unnecessary for the king to purchase what already belonged to him , there was no rice available to share . Finally Andriamasinavalona sought to purchase rice in Andraisisa . His money was refused by the local leader , Andriandrivotra , who willingly gave the king large shares of food and a tribute of silver . To reward the leader of the fief , Andriamasinavalona promised to give him anything he liked . Andriandrivotra declared that all he desired was the love of his sovereign . To show his appreciation , Andriamasinavalona declared that he would make Andriasisa into a great fief , and gave Andriandrivotra a large piece of land to the west of the territory . He then undertook a major expansion of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo , significantly increasing their rice production to feed the populace ."

    "text": "The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental — depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used , the HAZ can be of varying size and strength . The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role — if the diffusivity is high , the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small . Conversely , a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ . The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well , as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ . Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated , limited amount of heat , resulting in a small HAZ . Arc welding falls between these two extremes , with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input . To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures , the following formula can be used :"

Belgrano translated Quesnay 's book Maximes générales de gouvernement economique d 'un royaume agricole ( General Maxims of the Economical Government in an Agricultural Kingdom ) to Spanish . His main interest in the works of such authors were ideas that referred to the public good and popular prosperity . Like many South American students , he became interested in physiocracy , which stated that new wealth came from nature , that agriculture was an economic activity that generated more income than one needed , and that the state should not interfere at all with it . By that time , South America had plenty of natural resources and a very strict state interventionism in the economy . Belgrano developed the idea that the principles of physiocracy and those stated by Adam Smith could be applied together in the viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . In the development of this approach he was influenced by Fernando Galliani , who promoted the study of particular cases over theoric generalisations , and Antonio Genovesi , who thought that the absolute freedom promoted by physiocrats should be tempered by a moderate intervention by the state , such as the provision of free education for some . During his time in Europe , Belgrano became president of an Academy within the University of Salamanca devoted to Roman legislation , forensic practice and political economy ."

He was also convinced of the need for a strong , central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British empire , including the fractious provinces in North America .

State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives . If a person who works stops working , Shapiro observes , then they will typically find their economic situation worsened . Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this , and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work .

    "text": "In Ancient Roman times , a new Roman mythology was born through syncretization of numerous Greek and other foreign gods . This occurred because the Romans had little mythology of their own and inheritance of the Greek mythological tradition caused the major Roman gods to adopt characteristics of their Greek equivalents . The gods Zeus and Jupiter are an example of this mythological overlap . In addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions , the association of the Romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations . For instance , the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian 's successful campaigns in Syria . The Asiatic divinities Mithras ( that is to say , the Sun ) and Ba 'al were combined with Apollo and Helios into one Sol Invictus , with conglomerated rites and compound attributes . Apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with Helios or even Dionysus , but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments . The traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice . The worship of Sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by Christianity ."

    "text": "Homer is \" a ( happy ) slave to his various appetites \" , and would gladly sell his soul to the devil in exchange for a single doughnut . He has an apparently vacuous mind but at times exhibits a surprising depth of knowledge about various subjects , such as the composition of the Supreme Court of the United States , Incan mythology , bankruptcy law , and cell biology . Homer 's brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed , however , by much longer and consistent periods of ignorance , forgetfulness , and stupidity . Homer has a low IQ of 55 which has variously been attributed to the hereditary \" Simpson Gene \" ( which eventually causes every male member of the family to become incredibly stupid ) , his alcohol problem , exposure to radioactive waste , repetitive cranial trauma , and a crayon lodged in the frontal lobe of his brain . In the episode \" HOMR \" ( season 12 , 2001 ) Homer gets surgery to remove the ( newly discovered ) crayon from his brain , boosting his IQ to 105 , but although he bonds very well with Lisa , his newfound capacity for understanding and reason makes him less happy and he gets Moe to reinsert a crayon , causing his intelligence to return to its previous level . Homer often debates with his own mind , which is expressed in voiceover . His brain has a record of giving him dubious advice , sometimes helping him make the right decisions , but often failing spectacularly . It has even become completely frustrated and , through sound effects , walked out on him , Homer 's conversations with his brain were used several times during the fourth season , but were later phased out after the producers \" used every possible permutation \" . These exchanges were often introduced because they filled time and were easy for the animators to work on ."

    "text": "In 1822 the word \" paleontology \" was invented by the editor of a French scientific journal to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils , and the first half of the 19th century saw geological and paleontological activity become increasingly well organized with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists . This contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the history of life on Earth , and progress towards definition of the geologic time scale largely based on fossil evidence . As knowledge of life 's history continued to improve , it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life . This would encourage early evolutionary theories on the transmutation of species . After Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859 , much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths , including human evolution , and evolutionary theory ."

She viewed \" true history \" – the way she saw , defined , and proselytized it – as a potential common ground between North and South , and also believed it to be a potent political weapon in support of the causes she espoused . She was willing to alter the historical record to make her point -- in a speech in Dallas in 1916 she claimed that \" the negroes in the South were never called slaves . That term came in with the abolition crusade , \" even though her own state of Georgia used the word \" slaves \" in its official Declaration of Causes of Secession"

One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond more to the distress calls of prey than solitary species . Since S. fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits , and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey , this could mean that this species was social as well . One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors , such as body mass ( heavier animals are more likely to get stuck than lighter ones ) , intelligence ( some social animals , like the American lion , may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard ) , lack of visual and olfactory lures , the type of audio lure , and the length of the distress calls ( the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study ) . The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India , where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass . The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical , this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions . In addition , they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social ( and seemingly intelligent ) dire wolf is also found in the pits ."

To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness . The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment . This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( the GCHQ case ) . This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters ( GCHQ ) , a government signals and intelligence department , who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions . The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom . The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment @-@ related matters , even though it was not a rule . However , their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice . Such a representation can come in the form of a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision . Nonetheless , on the facts of the case , their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister 's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds ."

    "text": "Harrison used Campbell 's image filter theory , which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time . In this theory , filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem . More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs . Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being \" maximally flat \" . Norton 's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter . The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter , that is , one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance , whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends , making it hard to recognise the design for what it is . Another unusual feature of Norton 's filter design arises from the series capacitor , which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm . This is the only series capacitor in Norton 's representation , and without it , the filter could be analysed as a low @-@ pass prototype . Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit ( Norton 's figure 4 ) .

On his return from Wales , Garnet travelled with Anne Vaux to Rushton Hall , home of the recently deceased Thomas Tresham ( father to Francis Tresham ) . From there they travelled to Digby 's home at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire . Vaux was suspicious that so many horses were being collected at the homes of her friends and family , and confessed to Garnet her fear that \" these wild heads had something in hand \" . She asked him to speak with Catesby , but Garnet reassured her that Catesby was instead seeking a commission in Flanders . Garnet wrote a letter of recommendation for Catesby for that very purpose . When in October Vaux raised the issue once more , claiming that several women had asked her where they should retreat to once \" the brunt was passed in the beginning of Parliament \" , Garnet again mentioned Flanders , although Fraser suggests that Vaux 's questioning must have concerned him deeply ."

It had been written by Evan John Jones , a former member of the Clan of Tubal Cain who also lived in Brighton . Heselton has expressed the view that Valiente likely did more than this , and that she wrote a number of the chapters herself . As Valiente became better known , she came to correspond with a wide range of people within the Pagan and esoteric communities . Through this , she met the American Wiccan Starhawk – whom she greatly admired – on one of the latter 's visits to Britain . She also communicated with the American Wiccan and scholar of Pagan studies Aidan A. Kelly during his investigations into the early Gardnerian liturgies .

This road became known as the Conewago Road , Pack Horse Road , or the Wheelbarrow Road , the last due to the namesake implements being used to haul stones to widen the road by order of Maryland in 1793 .

    "text": "\" Ode on Indolence \" comprises six stanzas containing ten lines each . The poem discusses a morning of laziness on the part of the narrator , during which his attention becomes captivated by three figures he sees in a vision . Beginning with an epitaph taken from Matthew 6 : 28 , the poet introduces the theme of indolence through an excerpt of Jesus 's suggestion that God provides for the lilies of the field without making them toil . The poem describes the three figures as wearing \" placid sandals \" and \" white robes \" , which alludes to the Grecian mythology that commonly appears in the 1819 odes . The images pass the narrator three times , which causes him to compare them to images on a spinning urn ( line 7 ) . In line 10 , the narrator uses the word \" Phidian \" again as a reference to the Elgin marbles , whose creation was thought to have been overseen by Phidias , a Grecian artist . As the poem progresses , the narrator begins to discuss the intrusion upon his indolence by the figures of Love , Ambition , and Poesy , and he suggests that the images have come to \" steal away \" his idle days . In the final stanzas , the figure of Poesy is described as a daemon which Helen Vendler suggests poses a direct threat to the idleness the poet wishes to retain . In the final lines , the poet once again rejects the three images : \" Vanish , ye phantoms , from my idle spright , / Into the clouds , and never more return ! \" ( lines 39 – 40 ) with the intention of once again enjoying the laziness from which the poem obtains its title ."

In mid @-@ September , the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic , under the command of Prince Heinrich . He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau , but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan . Instead , the V Squadron was to carry the landing force , but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September . Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day , disembarked the landing force , and then proceeded to the North Sea , where they resumed guard ship duties . Before the end of the year , the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic ."

He made steady progress over the next three seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen . His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted much attention in the press , as did the next generation of amateur batsmen . He was appointed vice @-@ captain to Fender for the 1924 season , due in large part to the stigma attached to professional cricketers being appointed as captain . There were professionals such as Jack Hobbs playing for Surrey who could have been made captain , but Jardine was preferred as an amateur . In that season , Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match for the first time and came third in the Surrey averages . In all first @-@ class matches , he scored 1 @,@ 249 runs at an average of 40 @.@ 29 . The following season , Jardine was less successful , scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 ( 1 @,@ 020 runs at 30 @.@ 90 ) . It had also been suggested in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen , with a view towards the future of the England Test team , but this did not happen . In fact , owing to an injury sustained playing village cricket at Ashtead for a team called C.E. McIver 's XI , he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord 's . In 1926 , Jardine had his most successful season to date , with 1 @,@ 473 runs ( average 46 @.@ 03 ) , although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played . Towards the end of the season , his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased as he began to play more shots . His assurance and judgement against all bowling , even international bowlers , became noticed and he scored 538 runs in his final ten innings ."

Although it was Eadred who would achieve the final unification of England by the permanent conquest of Viking York , Æthelstan 's campaigns made this success possible . His nephew Edgar called himself King of the English and revived the claim to rule over all the peoples of Britain . Simon Keynes argued that \" the consistent usages of Edgar 's reign represent nothing less than a determined reaffirmation of the polity created by Æthelstan in the 930s \" . Historian Charles Insley , however , sees Æthelstan 's hegemony as fragile : \" The level of overlordship wielded by Æthelstan during the 930s over the rest of Britain was perhaps not attained again by an English king until Edward I. \" George Molyneaux argues that :"

    "text": "Masers and lasers built on Earth and masers that occur in space both require population inversion in order to operate , but the conditions under which population inversion occurs are very different in the two cases . Masers in laboratories have systems with high densities , which limits the transitions that may be used for masing , and requires using a resonant cavity in order to bounce light back and forth many times . Astrophysical masers are at low densities , and naturally have very long path lengths . At low densities , being out of thermal equilibrium is more easily achieved because thermal equilibrium is maintained by collisions , meaning population inversion can occur . Long path lengths provide photons traveling through the medium many opportunities to stimulate emission , and produce amplification of a background source of radiation . These factors accumulate to \" make interstellar space a natural environment for maser operation . \" Astrophysical masers may be pumped either radiatively or collisionally . In radiative pumping , infrared photons with higher energies than the maser transition photons preferentially excite atoms and molecules to the upper state in the maser in order to produce population inversion . In collisional pumping , this population inversion is instead produced by collisions that excite molecules to energy levels above that of the upper maser level , and then the molecule decays to the upper maser level by emitting photons ."

The initial Yarrow design was based on an expanded version of the British Shakespeare @-@ class , with five Skoda 14 cm / 56 naval guns . Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of the guns , to be replaced with a seaplane mounting .

In the late summer of 1929 , the KSCS ( the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 3 October 1929 ) signed a contract with Yarrow for a destroyer named Dubrovnik .

Most are three @-@ quarter face and half @-@ length . They typically set their models in front of a dark background that is uniform and nondescript . While the portraits are noted for their expressive pathos , the facial features of the women strongly resemble one another . This indicates that although van der Weyden did not adhere to the tradition of idealised representation , he sought to please his sitters in a manner that reflected contemporary ideals of beauty . Most of van der Weyden 's portraits were painted as commissions from the nobility ; he painted only five ( including Portrait of a Lady ) that were not donor portraits . It is known that in his Portrait of Philip de Croÿ ( c . 1460 ) , van der Weyden complimented the young Flemish nobleman by concealing his large nose and undershot jaw . When describing this tendency in relation to the Washington portrait , art historian Norbert Schneider wrote , \" While van Eyck shows nature ' in the raw ' , as it were , Rogier improves on physical reality , civilising and refining Nature and the human form with the help of a brush . \" The high quality of the painting is highlighted when compared to the National Gallery 's very similar workshop painting . The London subject has softer , more rounded features and is younger and less individually characterised than the c . 1460 model . The technique also is less subtle and fine in the London work . However , both share a similar expressions and dress ."

Because most of the works were donor portraits , very often the landscapes were tame , controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space .

In the dependence on the atomic mass number , the yield showed a saw @-@ tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes , due to their higher fission rates . The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast . Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 × 10 − 14 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude . Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10 − 7 of the total charge . The amount of transuranium elements in this 500 @-@ kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0 @.@ 4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test . This observation demonstrated the highly nonlinear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock . In order to accelerate sample collection after explosion , shafts were drilled at the site not after but before the test , so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter , through the shafts , to collecting volumes near the surface . This method was tried in the Anacostia and Kennebec tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material , but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling ; whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short @-@ lived isotopes , it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides ."

According to Lynch , \" her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist \" . Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A.

The texts that continue the story are \" generally regarded as dubious enterprises , as reviews attest \" and \" often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque \" . Those that emphasise nostalgia are \" defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking \" , relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions . Interest in Austen and adaptations of her novels have been common throughout the 20th century ; between 1900 and 1975 , more than sixty radio , television , film , and stage productions of Austen 's various works were produced ."

It is not yet clear , however , whether the epilepsy is usually caused by hippocampal abnormalities or whether the hippocampus is damaged by cumulative effects of seizures . In experimental settings where repetitive seizures are artificially induced in animals , hippocampal damage is a frequent result . This may be a consequence of the hippocampus 's being one of the most electrically excitable parts of the brain . It may also have something to do with the fact that the hippocampus is one of very few brain regions where new neurons continue to be created throughout life ."

He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker , more brownish , longer fur , and larger sphenopalatine vacuities ( openings in the mesopterygoid fossa , the gap behind the end of the palate ) . As Weksler 's 2006 analysis included only O. couesi and the marsh rice rat among species of Oryzomys in the strict sense , he could not test those groups . Carleton and Arroyo @-@ Cabrales concurred with Goldman 's division , listing additional characters , and noted that the palustris group may be more semiaquatically adapted than the members of the couesi group are . In the latter , the fur is usually reddish @-@ brown , as opposed to grayish @-@ brown in the palustris group . Members of the couesi group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller sphenopalatine foramen , a foramen ( opening ) in the side of the skull above the molars , and a more highly developed anterolabial cingulum on the third lower molar ( a crest at the front of the tooth ) . The hypothenar pad of the hindfoot , located on the sole far from the fingers , is present in the couesi group , but absent in the palustris group . Interdigital webbing may be more highly developed in the palustris group . Using morphological data , Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between O. couesi and O. gorgasi to the exclusion of O. palustris , but with low confidence . The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the palustris and couesi groups , but a Costa Rican sample ( assigned to O. couesi ) was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other ."

When seen from below , the lighter ventral area would similarly provide the least possible contrast with the sunlit ocean surface above . There is some evidence for this in birds , where birds that catch fish at a medium depth , rather than at the surface or on the seabed , are more often coloured in this way , and the prey of these birds would see only the underside of the bird .

It opens with a slow ( molto lento ) theme of harmonic ambiguity , followed by a second theme , equally ambiguous in key , though nominally in D major . The central section is in F ♯ major , and the re @-@ emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion . Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness , and of the composer 's struggle against despair . Pinkas , however , regards the work as a \" contrast between ambiguity and joy , ending in reassurance . \" It is sometimes known as the \" English \" nocturne , having been composed while Fauré was staying in the UK , and being dedicated to the English pianist Adela Maddison ."

He was perhaps elevated to the position of despot of Vidin soon after the accession of another Bulgarian noble of Cuman origin , George Terter I ( r . 1280 – 1292 ) , to the Bulgarian throne in 1280 . Shishman was likely a close relative , perhaps even a brother , of George Terter I."

This was because of the Andover workhouse scandal and the criticism of Henry Parker who was responsible for the Andover union as well as the tensions in Somerset House caused by Chadwick 's failure to become a Poor Law Commissioner . The Poor Law had been altered in 1834 because of increasing costs . The Workhouse Visiting Society which formed in 1858 highlighted conditions in workhouses and led to workhouses being inspected more often . The Union Chargeability Act was passed in 1865 in order to make the financial burden of pauperism be placed upon the whole unions rather than individual parishes . Most Boards of Guardians were middle class and committed to keeping Poor Rates as low as possible . After the Reform Act 1867 there was increasing welfare legislation . As this legislation required local authorities ' support the Poor Law Board was replaced with a Local Government Board in 1871 . The Local Government Board led a crusade against outdoor relief supported by the Charity Organisation Society , an organization which viewed outdoor relief as destroying the self @-@ reliance of the poor . The effect of this renewed effort to deter outdoor relief was to reduce claimants by a third and to increase numbers in the work house by 12 – 15 % . County Councils were formed in 1888 , District Councils in 1894 . This meant that public housing , unlike health and income maintenance , developed outside the scope of the Poor Law . Poor Law policy after the New Poor Law concerning the elderly , the sick and mentally ill and children became more humane .

    "text": "In the Zagreb Corps area , the HV moved across the Kupa River at two points towards Glina — in and near Pokupsko , using the 20th Home Guard Regiment and the 153rd Brigade . Both crossings established bridgeheads , although the bulk of the units were forced to retreat as the ARSK counter @-@ attacked — only a battalion of the 153rd Brigade and elements of the 20th Home Guard Regiment held their ground . The crossings prompted the ARSK General Staff to order the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the Special Units Corps to move from Slunj to the bridgeheads , as the HV advance threatened a vital road in Glina . The HV 2nd Guards Brigade and the 12th Home Guard Regiment were tasked with the quick capture of Petrinja from the ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade in a pincer movement . The original plan , involving thrusts six to seven kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 3 miles ) south of Petrinja , was amended by Basarac to a direct assault on the city . On the right flank , the regiment was soon stopped by minefields and forced to retreat , while the bulk of the 2nd Guards Brigade advanced until it wavered following the loss of a company commander and five soldiers . The rest of the 2nd Guards Brigade — reinforced by the 2nd Battalion , elements of the 12th Home Guard Regiment , the 5th Antitank Artillery Battalion and the 31st Engineers Battalion — formed Tactical Group 2 ( TG2 ) operating on the left flank of the attack . TG2 advanced from Mošćenica , a short distance from Petrinja , but was stopped after the 2nd Battalion 's commander and six soldiers were killed . The ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade also panicked but managed to stabilize its defences as it received reinforcements . The HV 57th Brigade advanced south of Petrinja , intent on reaching the Petrinja – Hrvatska Kostajnica road , but ran into a minefield where the brigade commander was killed , while the 101st Brigade to its rear suffered heavy artillery fire and casualties . In the Sunja area , the 17th Home Guard Regiment and a company of the 151st Brigade unsuccessfully attacked the ARSK 26th Infantry Brigade . Later that day , a separate attack by the rest of the 151st Brigade also failed . The HV 103rd Brigade advanced to the Sunja – Sisak railroad , but had to retreat under heavy fire . The Zagreb Corps failed to meet any objective of the first day . This was attributed to inadequate manpower and as a result the corps requested the mobilization of the 102nd Brigade and the 1st and 21st Home Guard Regiments . The 2nd Guards Brigade was reinforced by the 1st Battalion of the 149th Brigade previously held in reserve in Ivanić Grad ."

This second theme is reminiscent of Keats 's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain . The Elysian fields and the nightingale 's song in the first half of the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug . However , the experience does not last forever , and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure . Instead of embracing the coming truth , the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure . Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for , but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure ."

When Henry 's sons rebelled against him in 1173 Rhys sent his son Hywel Sais to Normandy to aid the king , then in 1174 personally led an army to Tutbury in Staffordshire to assist at the siege of the stronghold of the rebel Earl William de Ferrers . When Rhys returned to Wales after the fall of Tutbury , he left a thousand men with the king for service in Normandy . King Henry held a council at Gloucester in 1175 which was attended by a large gathering of Welsh princes , led by Rhys . It appears to have concluded with the swearing of a mutual assistance pact for the preservation of peace and order in Wales . In 1177 Rhys , Dafydd ab Owain , who had emerged as the main power in Gwynedd , and Cadwallon ap Madog from Rhwng Gwy a Hafren swore fealty and liege homage to Henry at a council held at Oxford . At this council the king gave Meirionnydd , part of the kingdom of Gwynedd , to Rhys . There was some fighting in Meirionnydd the following year , but Rhys apparently made no serious attempt to annex it ."

Once the steam explosions had subsided , the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water , creating the unvolcano @-@ like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite .

    "text": "Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published : \" And death shall have no dominion \" , \" Before I Knocked \" and \" The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower \" . \" And death shall have no dominion \" appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933 . When \" Light breaks where no sun shines \" appeared in The Listener in 1934 , it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London , T. S. Eliot , Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender . They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume , 18 Poems , was published in December 1934 . 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was \" the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years \" . The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee , netting him new admirers from the London poetry world , including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir . The anthology was published by Fortune Press , in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves . A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin . In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem \" The Hand That Signed the Paper \" to Issue 18 of the bi @-@ monthly New Verse . In 1936 , his next collection Twenty @-@ five Poems , published by J. M. Dent , also received much critical praise . In all , he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London . It was the time that Thomas 's reputation for heavy drinking developed ."

The Bavarian royal collection ( now in the Alte Pinakothek , Munich ) opened to the public in 1779 , that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 ( as the Uffizi Gallery ) , and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793 . Great Britain , however , did not emulate the continental model , and the British Royal Collection remains in the sovereign 's possession today . In 1777 the British government had the opportunity to buy an art collection of international stature , when the descendants of Sir Robert Walpole put his collection up for sale . The MP John Wilkes argued for the government to buy this \" invaluable treasure \" and suggested that it be housed in \" a noble gallery ... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum \" Nothing came of Wilkes 's appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great ; it is now to be found in the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg ."

The CNSA was also supported in its early activities by Charles de Broqueville 's Belgian government in exile . The logistical problems involved in coordinating the huge shipments of food to Belgium meant that the CNSA began to look for foreign assistance in procuring and transporting material to Belgium . Francqui used his personal acquaintance with Herbert Hoover , future President of the United States , to create an external body to assist the management of the CNSA . Hoover became the director of the Commission for Relief in Belgium ( CRB ) , and led successful attempts to raise money abroad in order to improve the humanitarian situation in Belgium .

This effort continued after his death during the War of the Spanish Succession . Another important consequence of William 's reign in England involved the ending of a bitter conflict between Crown and Parliament that had lasted since the accession of the first English monarch of the House of Stuart , James I , in 1603 . The conflict over royal and parliamentary power had led to the English Civil War during the 1640s and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 . During William 's reign , however , the conflict was settled in Parliament 's favour by the Bill of Rights 1689 , the Triennial Act 1694 and the Act of Settlement 1701 ."

She wrote on pornography from a feminist perspective and in opposition to obscenity law , and she worked with Women Against Pornography and Linda Boreman . She considered the pornography industry to be based on turning women into objects for abuse by men . Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon developed a legislative approach based on civil rights rather than obscenity to outlaw pornography and allow lawsuits against pornographers for damages , but their efforts were largely unsuccessful . She testified at a Federal commission against pornography , leading some stores to withdraw certain magazines from sale , but a court ruled the government 's efforts unconstitutional . Critics argued that no causal relationship between pornography and harm to women had been found . A Canadian court adapted parts of Dworkin and MacKinnon 's theory on sex equality , although Dworkin opposed parts of the court 's view . Some sex @-@ positive feminists criticized Dworkin 's views as censorious and as denying women 's agency or choice in sexual relationships , leading to the so @-@ called feminist sex wars ."

The Cuban Revolution in 1959 and the subsequent USA attempt to thwart it through the Bay of Pigs Invasion can be seen as the start of this period . Cuba 's vulnerability led it to closer ties with the USSR , resulting in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 when the US and USSR came dangerously close to nuclear war . Throughout the 1960s and 1970s military authoritarian regimes ruled in Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Paraguay , Peru and many others .

Near the coastline , offshore winds move the warm waters near the surface offshore , and replace them with cooler water from below in the process known as Ekman transport . This pattern increases nutrients for marine life in the region . Offshore river deltas , freshwater flows over the top of the denser seawater , which allows it to heat faster due to limited vertical mixing . Remotely sensed SST can be used to detect the surface temperature signature due to tropical cyclones . In general , an SST cooling is observed after the passing of a hurricane primarily as the result of mixed layer deepening and surface heat losses .

    "text": "McClintock was widely credited for discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered the process in bacteria , yeast , and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s . During this period , molecular biology had developed significant new technology , and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition . In the 1970s , Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons . Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase , which is required for the element to move within the genome . Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene , which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase . Thus , as McClintock observed , Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac . Spm has also been characterized as a transposon . Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress , such as by irradiation or the breakage @-@ fusion @-@ bridge cycle , and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution . McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept .

This early historiography was influential in successfully overhauling the system . Blaug presents the first revisionist analysis of the Poor Law in “ The Myth of the Old Poor Law and the making of the New ” , arguing that the Old Poor Law did not reduce the efficiency of agricultural workers , lower wages , depress rents or compound the burden on rate payers . Instead Blaug argues that Old Poor Law was a device \" for dealing with the problems of structural unemployment and substandard wages in the lagging rural sector of a rapidly growing but still underdeveloped economy \" . Other areas of Poor Law which have concerned historians include the extent to which the Second Great Reform Act contributed to the Poor Law Amendment Act and the extent to which outdoor relief was abolished following the New Poor Law ."

His minimalist style sharply contrasted with the emphasis placed on virtuosity and speed by heavy metal in the 1980s . The Edge views musical notes as \" expensive \" , preferring to play as few of them as possible and to instead focus on simpler parts that serve the moods of the songs .

For example , the riff in the introduction of the opening track \" Where the Streets Have No Name \" is a repeated six @-@ note arpeggio , with delay used to repeat notes . The riffs to \" I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For \" and \" With or Without You \" also prominently use delay , with Bono likening the guitar hook from the former track to \" chrome bells \" .

    "text": "Directed acyclic graphs may also be used as a compact representation of a collection of sequences . In this type of application , one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences . When many of the sequences share the same subsequences , these shared subsequences can be represented by a shared part of the DAG , allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately . For example , the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols ; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings , such as English words . Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree , by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element ; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a trie . A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a trie by allowing paths to diverge and rejoin , so that a set of words with the same possible suffixes can be represented by a single tree vertex ."

Williams also noted that this area was quite remote from Orkney , and that it may have been outside of the control of the earldom . The saga states that Ölvir and Frakökk had spies on the lookout ; however , because of the route taken by Sveinn , they were unaware of his presence until Svienn occupied a certain slope behind their homestead . The saga states that Ölvir and sixty of his men confronted Sveinn , although Þormóður Torfason 's account of the incident gives forty . After a short clash , the saga states that , Ölvir 's men soon gave way , and many were killed in the ensuing rout . Ölvir survived the clash , and fled up Helmsdale river . Meanwhile , Sveinn and his men continued on towards the houses . The area was plundered , and the houses were burnt to the ground with their inmates still inside — and in this way Frakökk perished . The saga states that Sveinn and his men committed many ravages in Sutherland before returning home . Upon reaching the river , Ölvir fled through the mountains , and is last heard making for the Suðreyjar ; he is not mentioned again within the Orkneyinga saga . Later on within the saga , another of Frakökk 's grandsons , Þórbjörn ' Clerk ' , who is a brother @-@ in @-@ law and close friend of Sveinn , has two of Sveinn 's men killed for their part in the burning ."

Thorn included Adams among a group of \" powerfully influential figures \" from the period — also including Louis F. Wadsworth and Wheaton — who he writes \" went unrecognized in their lifetimes and became mysteries to future generations . \" Alexander Cartwright was more widely recognized as a pioneering figure for the sport . The Baseball Hall of Fame has claimed that Cartwright was the inventor of 90 @-@ foot ( 27 m ) baselines and the nine @-@ inning game . However , by the time conventions led by Adams had enacted those rules in the late 1850s , Cartwright had traveled to California and was no longer a member of the Knickerbockers . Adams is said to have avoided \" campaigning for credit \" for rules changes after he left the Knickerbockers ; researcher Gary O 'Maxfield said of him that he \" didn 't like to brag . \" Several of the rules approved at the conventions survived to modern baseball , including the 90 @-@ foot ( 27 m ) baseline distance . The 45 @-@ foot ( 14 m ) distance from home plate to the pitching mound , however , did not last through the 19th century ; it was pushed back 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in 1880 . The shortstop position , which for Adams was located between the infielders and outfielders , was later played in the infield , between second and third base . Dickey Pearce was the first player to field in that area , and his ability to prevent base hits in the formerly unoccupied territory convinced other teams to employ similar tactics ."

It was later reduced to a variety of Lycoperdon gemmatum ( as L. gemmatum var. echinatum ; L. gemmatum is now known as Lycoperdon perlatum ) by Elias Magnus Fries , but American mycologist Charles Horton Peck , who extensively studied the North American distribution of the genus , raised it again to species level in 1879 . He thought it worthy of status as a species distinct from L. gemmatum because of the different character of its warts , its much spinier appearance , and the smoother surface of the peridium underneath the spines . Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome wrote of the fungus in 1871 , but believed their specimen , collected from Reading , Berkshire , by Hoyle , represented a new species , which they called Lycoperdon Hoylei . They wrote that their specimen agreed \" exactly with an authentic specimen of Persoon 's L. echinatum externally , who could , however , scarcely have overlooked the lilac spores . \" Despite the apparent difference in spore color , L. Hoylei is currently considered synonymous with L. echinatum . Utraria echinata , named by Lucien Quélet in 1873 , is another synonym for L. echinatum ."

The amatoxins inhibit the enzyme RNA polymerase II , which copies the genetic code of DNA into messenger RNA molecules . The toxin naturally accumulates in liver cells , and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins . Amatoxins also lead to kidney failure because , as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison , it damages the convoluted tubules and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage . Initial symptoms after ingestion include severe abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea which may last for six to nine hours .

Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price , as well as the flexibility and security of the supply , whereas local sources aren 't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed , contracted prices . The station is not an established importer of coal , having only imported since 2005 . It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside , Hull and Immingham , which have been booked by power stations closer to them . This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne . However , because of the small sizes of these docks , they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia . Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though , the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia . The environmental impact of shipping 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12 @,@ 812 tonnes of CO2 , whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2 .

Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231 @.@ 4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time . Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs ; if this is true , its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small , bipedal predators . The discovery of primitive , dinosaur @-@ like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view ; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small , bipedal predators . Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago , as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period , though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives ."

The brothers had kept in communication with the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace , and misled them into believing that they were still in the palace . The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile ; after being arrested , they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base . While no formal inquiry was conducted , the responsibility for the deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh 's bodyguard , Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung , and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa , both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip . Minh 's army colleagues and U.S. officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions . They postulated various motives , including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace , and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback . The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide , but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs ' corpses surfaced in the media ."

The deceased was required to pass a series of gates , caverns and mounds guarded by supernatural creatures . These terrifying entities were armed with enormous knives and are illustrated in grotesque forms , typically as human figures with the heads of animals or combinations of different ferocious beasts . Their names — for instance , \" He who lives on snakes \" or \" He who dances in blood \" — are equally grotesque . These creatures had to be pacified by reciting the appropriate spells included in the Book of the Dead ; once pacified they posed no further threat , and could even extend their protection to the dead person . Another breed of supernatural creatures was ' slaughterers ' who killed the unrighteous on behalf of Osiris ; the Book of the Dead equipped its owner to escape their attentions . As well as these supernatural entities , there were also threats from natural or supernatural animals , including crocodiles , snakes , and beetles ."

This chronicle , written in Latin , was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town of Bar , then part of the Serbian Kingdom . Its author was Rudger , the Catholic Archbishop of Bar , who was probably of Czech origin . He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir , written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089 . This is the period when Duklja 's rulers from the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope , and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric . They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty ; they were , according to the chronicle , descendants of his uncle Dragimir . The Vojislavljevićs succeeded in those endeavors , though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church . Despite its hagiographic nature , Chapter 36 contains a lot of reliable historical data . Chapters 34 and 35 , which deal with Vladimir 's father and uncles , are probably based on the prologue of the 11th @-@ century hagiography .

But many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day .

The Senate began giving tribunes more power , and the tribunes began to feel indebted to the Senate . As the tribunes and the senators grew closer , plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for members of their own families . Also , this period saw the enacting of the Ovinian Law , which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors . This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate , which probably resulted in a significant increase in the number of plebeian senators ."

This led Katy Waldman of Slate to ponder why \" Imagine \" had become so frequently performed as a response to tragedy . In addition to its general popularity , she noted its musical simplicity , its key of C major , \" the plainest and least complicated key , with no sharps or flats \" aside from one passage with \" a plaintive major seventh chord that allows a tiny bit of E minor into the tonic \" . That piano part , \" gentle as a rocking chair \" , underpins lyrics that , Waldman says , \" belongs to the tradition of hymns or spirituals that visualize a glorious afterlife without prophesizing any immediate end to suffering on earth \" . This understanding is also compounded by the historical context of Lennon 's own violent death , \" remind [ ing ] us that the universe can run ramshod over idealistic people \" .

    "text": "The game 's audio was created by Martin Stig Andersen , a graduate from the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus . Andersen 's specialisation was in acousmatic music , non @-@ traditional music created from generated sounds that have no apparent visual source . He was drawn to work with Jensen on the game after seeing the initial trailer , having been drawn in by the expressions of the boy character ; Andersen compared the early visuals to his acousmatic music : \" you have something recognizable and realistic , but at the same time it 's abstract \" . Andersen sought to create acousmatic music exclusively incorporating the sound effects of the game 's environments . Two examples he pointed to was the use of electricity noises while in the presence of a ruined neon \" HOTEL \" sign , and silencing the wind sound as the spider approached the boy in the forest . Andersen avoided the use of easily recognizable sounds , distorting them when needed as to allow players to interpret the sounds ' meanings for themselves . Andersen constructed most of the game 's sounds through a number of \" grains \" instead of longer sound loops , allowing him to adjust the playback to give better feedback to the player without sounding repetitious ; one example he cites was the use of separate sounds for the boy 's toe and heel when they make contact with the ground , giving a more realistic sound for movement . Many reviews for the game stated that there was no music in Limbo , but Andersen countered that his sound arrangements helped to evoke emotions ; the acousmatic music was intended to leave room for interpretation by the player in the same manner as the game 's art and story . Andersen noted that this helps with immersion within the game by making no attempt to control the emotional tone ; \" if [ the players are ] scared it will probably make them more scared when there 's no music to take them by the hand and tell them how to feel \" . Due to fans ' requests , Playdead released the game 's soundtrack on iTunes Store on 11 July 2011 ."

The film made her a minor local celebrity , and led to her being spotted by Jacques Baratier who offered her a minor role in Goha . She accepted it reluctantly after Baratier explained he wanted a Tunisian actress rather than an Italian to star in the main role opposite the Egyptian actor Omar Sharif . The appearance nonetheless marked her feature film debut . The turning point came in 1957 during the Italian Cinema Week in Tunis when she won a competition for the \" Most Beautiful Italian Girl in Tunisia \" , with a trip to the Venice Film Festival as first prize . After being spotted by several film producers at the event , she was invited to study at the Experimental Cinematography Center in Rome under Tina Lattanzi . She attended briefly as , despite her extremely photogenic looks , she had trouble with her acting assignments ( partly owing to her difficulties with the Italian language ) . She left at the end of her first term and decided to return home , earning herself a cover story in the popular weekly Epoca triggered by her unexpected decision to turn her back on a career as a film star ."

    "text": "The name wildfire was once a synonym for Greek fire but now refers to any large or destructive conflagration . Wildfires differ from other fires in that they take place outdoors in areas of grassland , woodlands , bushland , scrubland , peatland , and other wooded areas that act as a source of fuel , or combustible material . All wildfires can be characterized by their physical properties , fuel type , or weather 's effect on the fire , regardless of the fire 's cause or outcome . Wildfire behaviour and severity result from the combination of factors such as available fuels , physical setting , and weather . While wildfires can be large , uncontrolled disasters that burn through 0 @.@ 4 to 400 square kilometres ( 100 to 100 @,@ 000 acres ) or more , they can also be as small as 0 @.@ 001 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 25 acres ; 1 @,@ 000 m2 ) or less . Although smaller events may be included in wildfire modeling , most do not earn press attention .

These remnant systems may persist for up to several days before losing their identity . This dissipation mechanism is most common in the eastern North Pacific . Weakening or dissipation can occur if it experiences vertical wind shear , causing the convection and heat engine to move away from the center ; this normally ceases development of a tropical cyclone . In addition , its interaction with the main belt of the Westerlies , by means of merging with a nearby frontal zone , can cause tropical cyclones to evolve into extratropical cyclones . This transition can take 1 – 3 days . Even after a tropical cyclone is said to be extratropical or dissipated , it can still have tropical storm force ( or occasionally hurricane / typhoon force ) winds and drop several inches of rainfall . In the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean , such tropical @-@ derived cyclones of higher latitudes can be violent and may occasionally remain at hurricane or typhoon @-@ force wind speeds when they reach the west coast of North America . These phenomena can also affect Europe , where they are known as European windstorms ; Hurricane Iris 's extratropical remnants are an example of such a windstorm from 1995 . A cyclone can also merge with another area of low pressure , becoming a larger area of low pressure . This can strengthen the resultant system , although it may no longer be a tropical cyclone . Studies in the 2000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones ."

According to Chandler , by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input .

This endangered status continued through several reassessments in 1986 , 1988 , 1990 , and 1994 until it was upgraded in status to critically endangered in 1996 . Two petitions challenged its status as an endangered species prior to this , claiming the turtle ( along with three other species ) had several significant stable populations worldwide . These petitions were rejected based on their analysis of data submitted by the Marine Turtle Specialist Group ( MTSG ) . The data given by the MTSG showed the worldwide hawksbill sea turtle population had declined by 80 % in the three most recent generations , and no significant population increase occurred as of 1996 . CR A2 status was denied , however , because the IUCN did not find sufficient data to show the population likely to decrease by a further 80 % in the future ."

She and Heseltine soon entered into a passionate love affair . During this summer break Heseltine shocked neighbours by his uninhibited behaviour , which included riding a motorcycle naked down nearby Crickley Hill . However , his letters show that at this time he was often depressed and insecure , lacking any clear sense of purpose . In November 1915 his life gained some impetus when he met D. H.

Heseltine declared Lawrence to be \" the greatest literary genius of his generation \" , and enthusiastically fell in with the writer 's plans to found a Utopian colony in America . In late December he followed the Lawrences to Cornwall , where he tried , unavailingly , to set up a publishing company with them . Passions between Heseltine and Puma had meanwhile cooled ; when she revealed that she was pregnant , Heseltine confided to Delius that he had little liking for her and had no intention of helping her to raise this unwanted child ."
