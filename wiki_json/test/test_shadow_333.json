The band completed recording in six days ; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini , whom the singer heard \" was supposedly this sexist jerk \" , but called the process \" the easiest recording we 've ever done , hands down \" .

Lansdale 's report predicted South Vietnam 's demise , and along with it , the rest of South East Asia and US preeminence in global affairs , unless a new direction was found . He blamed what he saw as Durbrow 's poor judgement for the problems in the alliance , and that the current ambassador could not work effectively anymore because he had \" sympathized strongly \" with the coup . Without explicitly suggesting himself , Lansdale said that Durbrow had to be replaced with someone \" with marked leadership talents \" and the ability to \" influence Asians through understanding them sympathetically \" . Lansdale called Diệm \" the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President \" and said the new ambassador needed thus needed to have a rapport with him . Lansdale said Diệm was comfortable with MAAG and the CIA , but felt that diplomats were \" very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11 \" . During the meeting at which these matters were discussed , there was strong agreement that Durbrow 's position in Saigon had become untenable . Lansdale 's submissions were seen as being important in Kennedy 's decision to replace Durbrow with Frederick Nolting in May 1961 . Nolting was a mild man who was seen as unlikely to pressure Diệm to reform and therefore upset him . Kennedy was thought to have seriously contemplated the appointment of Lansdale , before encountering complaints from sections of the State and Defense Departments , among them Defense Secretary Robert McNamara . Kennedy also increased funding for Diệm immediately and made a show of support for the Vietnamese leader at the advice of Lansdale ."

Every previous pnictogen has five electrons in its valence shell , forming a valence electron configuration of ns2np3 . In ununpentium 's case , the trend should be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p3 ; therefore , ununpentium will behave similarly to its lighter congeners in many respects . However , notable differences are likely to arise ; a largely contributing effect is the spin – orbit ( SO ) interaction — the mutual interaction between the electrons ' motion and spin . It is especially strong for the superheavy elements , because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms , at velocities comparable to the speed of light . In relation to ununpentium atoms , it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels ( stabilizing the corresponding electrons ) , but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four . The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect , and the effect \" tearing \" the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting . Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second ( azimuthal ) quantum number l from 1 to 1 ⁄ 2 and 3 ⁄ 2 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell , respectively . For many theoretical purposes , the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s27p2"

The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative . These included acts of diplomacy ( including royal marriages ) , declarations of war , management of the coinage , the issue of royal pardons and the power to summon and dissolve parliament as and when required . Nevertheless , as evident during Henry 's break with Rome , the monarch worked within established limits , whether legal or financial , that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and parliament ( representing the gentry ) . In practice , Tudor monarchs used patronage to maintain a royal court that included formal institutions such as the Privy Council as well as more informal advisers and confidants . Both the rise and fall of court nobles could be swift : although the often @-@ quoted figure of 72 @,@ 000 executions during his reign is inflated , Henry did undoubtedly execute at will , burning or beheading two of his wives , twenty peers , four leading public servants , six close attendants and friends , one cardinal ( John Fisher ) and numerous abbots . Among those who were in favour at any given point in Henry 's reign , one could usually be identified as a chief minister , though one of the enduring debates in the historiography of the period has been the extent to which those chief ministers controlled Henry rather than vice versa . In particular , historian G. R. Elton has argued that one such minister , Thomas Cromwell , led a \" Tudor revolution in government \" quite independent of the king , whom Elton presented as an opportunistic , essentially lazy participant in the nitty @-@ gritty of politics . Where Henry did intervene personally in the running of the country , Elton argued , he mostly did so to its detriment .

This implies either that he was a Hyksos king reigning after Khyan , in contradiction with Khyan 's known successors Apophis and Khamudi ; or that he belonged to another dynasty ."

Totals of over 700 mm ( 28 in ) were reported along the upper Umfolozi , Mkuze , Pongola and middle Usutu and Komati rivers , and along the upper and lower Ingwavuma river . Precipitation spread as far south as Durban , but did not penetrate far into the center of the country . An area of about 107 @,@ 000 km2 ( 41 @,@ 000 sq mi ) received 370 mm ( 15 in ) of rainfall . Along the Umfolozi River , a discharge rate of 16 @,@ 000 m ³ / s ( 565 @,@ 000 ft ³ / s ) was recorded , which was three times the rate of a 100 year flood . The river avulsed , or changed its course , near where it met with the Msunduzi River . High rains in the mountains caused the largest flood to date along the Pongola River . The floodplain downstream of the Pongolapoort Dam was inundated to where the Pongola met the Ututu River , which filled many pans – dry lakes – in the region . Along 29 river locations in eastern South Africa , river heights were estimated to have been 1 in 50 year events . The river flooding moved sediment along many banks , and in one location the sediment reached 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) in length . Due to the widespread flooding and the remoteness of the worst affected areas , there were minimal measurements on the river flow along the Pongola , although above the Pongolapoort dam , levels reached 13 @,@ 000 m ³ / s ( 460 @,@ 000 ft ³ / s ) , which were 18 times higher than the previous record highest . There had been a planned release of water from the Pongolapoort Dam in March 1984 to provide adequate water to the floodplain , but Domoina prevented this from occurring . The dam had its highest hydrology on January 31 and reached 87 % of its capacity . Waters from the dam were released on February 2 to prevent the dam from exceeding capacity . With the future threat of Cyclone Imboa , dam levels continued to drop until returning to normal by February 16 , despite requests to hold the water to prevent further crop damage ."

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time , and yet the universe today remains very close to flat . Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time , 10 − 43 seconds , the fact that the universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation .

    "text": "The main driver of Jupiter 's magnetosphere is the planet 's rotation . In this respect Jupiter is similar to a device called a Unipolar generator . When Jupiter rotates , its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet . Because the dipole magnetic moment points in the direction of the rotation , the Lorentz force , which appears as a result of this motion , drives negatively charged electrons to the poles , while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator . As a result , the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged . Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma , the electrical circuit is closed through it . A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet . This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles . The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field @-@ aligned or Birkeland currents . The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field , and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation . This is the main mechanism that maintains co @-@ rotation of the plasma in Jupiter 's magnetosphere ."

There is some evidence , including Gregory 's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission , that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time . The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship , if Bertha 's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen .

The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Diệm . The incidence of Việt Cộng attacks continued to increase as it had done during the summer of 1963 , the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell . The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside . The falsification of military statistics by Diệm 's officials had led to miscalculations , which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Diệm 's death . Aside from battlefield setbacks , something that was outside his remit , Thơ was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment .

At the turn of the century , Poland became ruled by the House of Vasa , and was involved in a series of wars with Sweden ( see also dominium maris baltici ) .

    "text": "Fielding uses Luckless and The Author 's Farce to portray aspects of his life , including his experience with the London theatre community . The plot serves as revenge for the Theatre Royal 's rejection of Fielding 's earlier plays . However , this and his being forced into minor theatres proved beneficial , because it allowed him more freedom to experiment with his plays in ways that would have been unacceptable at larger locations . This experimentation , beginning with The Author 's Farce , is an attempt by Fielding to try writing in formats beyond the standard five @-@ act comedy play . Though he returned to writing five @-@ act plays later , many of his plays contain plot structures that differ from those common to contemporary plays . To distinguish his satirical intent , Fielding claims that the work was written by \" Scriblerus Secundus , \" which places his play within an earlier literary tradition . The name refers to the Scriblerus Club , a satirical group whose members included Alexander Pope , Jonathan Swift , John Gay , and John Arbuthnot . Fielding 's use of the pseudonym connects his play to the satirical writings of the Scriblerus Club 's members , and reveals their influence on his new style , such as incorporating in their work the styles of the entertainments that they were ridiculing . Fielding thus allows the audience to believe that he is poking fun at others , less discriminating than themselves , and less able to distinguish good art from bad . Fielding also borrowed characters from the work of the Club 's members , such as the Goddess of Nonsense , influenced by Pope 's character from The Dunciad , Dulness , who is at war with reason . Nonsense , like Dulness , is a force that promotes the corruption of literature and taste , to which Fielding adds a sexual element . This sexuality is complicated , yet also made comical , when Nonsense chooses a castrated man as her mate . Her choice emphasises a lack of morality , one of the problems that Fielding believed dominated 18th @-@ century British society . Despite the link to Dulness , the general satire of the play more closely resembles Gay 's Beggar 's Opera than the other works produced by the Scriblerus Club ."

    "text": "Cubic boron nitride ( CBN or c @-@ BN ) is widely used as an abrasive . Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in iron , nickel , and related alloys at high temperatures , whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides . Polycrystalline c @-@ BN ( PCBN ) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel , whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys , ceramics , and stone . When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures , BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide . Boron nitride binds well with metals , due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides . Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the tool bits of cutting tools . For grinding applications , softer binders , e.g. resin , porous ceramics , and soft metals , are used . Ceramic binders can be used as well . Commercial products are known under names \" Borazon \" ( by Diamond Innovations ) , and \" Elbor \" or \" Cubonite \" ( by Russian vendors ) . Similar to diamond , the combination in c @-@ BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders .

Traditionally , as the property of the Crown , Windsor Castle was maintained , and if necessary repaired , by the British government in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate . Furthermore , like other occupied royal palaces , it was not insured on grounds of economy . At the time of the fire , however , the British press strongly argued in favour of the Queen herself being required to pay for the repairs from her private income . A solution was found in which the restoration work would be paid for by opening Buckingham Palace to the public at selected times of the year , and by introducing new charges for public access to the parkland surrounding Windsor . The second major issue concerned how to repair the castle . Some suggested that the damaged rooms should be restored to their original appearance , but others favoured repairing the castle so as to incorporate modern designs . The decision was taken to largely follow the pre @-@ fire architecture with some changes to reflect modern tastes and cost , but fresh questions emerged over whether the restoration should be undertaken to \" authentic \" or \" equivalent \" restoration standards .

Al @-@ Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea . This is close to the silk route , so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable . Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high . As the Varangian Rus ' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian ( using their Volga trade route , it is possible that the technology reached Sweden by this means . High quality ores , water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden . However , since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people , it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently . The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big . Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures , bloom melting into liquid iron and , cast iron flowing from the smelters . Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows , which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast ."

Prior to the signing , the Ducks made two key acquisitions , signing playmaking centre Adam Oates to a one @-@ year deal and trading for winger Petr Sýkora from the New Jersey Devils . Both acquisitions were made with Kariya 's input , as well as with the expectation they would play on a line with him . Although Oates was injured at the beginning of the season ( during which time Kariya played with his usual centre , Rucchin ) , the trio formed the Ducks ' top line . Despite playing under a defensive system , implemented by new head coach Mike Babcock , the arrival of Kariya 's new linemates coincided with a resurgence in offensive production for him in 2002 – 03 . Several months into the campaign , however , his father died of a heart attack . The Ducks gave Kariya the option to sit out the following game against the Vancouver Canucks , which he played nonetheless on December 28 , 2002 . He recorded an assist in a 7 – 3 loss . At mid @-@ season , Kariya was selected as a reserve to his seventh and final NHL All @-@ Star Game , held in February 2003 . He scored the deciding shootout goal for the Western Conference , as his team beat the East 6 – 5 . While his 25 goals marked the lowest total of his career since his 22 @-@ game 1997 – 98 season , his 56 assists approached a personal best . With 81 points over 82 games , he led the Ducks in scoring for the fifth time . His efforts helped the Mighty Ducks to the seventh seed in the West , marking the team 's return to the playoffs for the first time in four years . Matching up against the second @-@ seeded Red Wings in the first round , Kariya opened the playoffs with a triple @-@ overtime winner in Game 1 , resulting in a 2 – 1 Ducks win . Anaheim went on to sweep the Red Wings in four games ; Kariya scored his second goal of the series in the deciding contest , a 3 – 2 overtime win . It marked the second time in league history that a team eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion in four @-@ straight games in the first round . The Mighty Ducks went on to eliminate the Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild in the next two rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history . During Game 6 of the series against New Jersey , a contest in which the Ducks faced elimination , Kariya received a hard open @-@ ice hit from opposing defenceman Scott Stevens . Laying motionless on the ice for several minutes , he needed to be helped to the dressing room . Many felt Kariya 's equipment changes following his first concussion may have saved him from being rendered unconscious from the Stevens hit . Four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes of playing time later , he returned to the game . Following his return , he scored on a slapshot while skating down the wing to give the Ducks a 4 – 1 lead . Anaheim went on to win the game 5 – 2 to force a Game 7 ; Kariya finished the contest with a goal and two assists . Reactions regarding Stevens ' hit were divided following the game . Kariya told reporters that after looking at replays that Stevens had used his elbow , while Ducks Head Coach Mike Babcock described it as a late hit . The play was not penalized during the game , however , and Stevens received no disciplinary measures from the League . Playing the deciding Game 7 in New Jersey , the Ducks lost the Stanley Cup by a 3 – 0 score . Over 21 games , Kariya finished third on the team in playoff scoring ( behind Adam Oates and Petr Sýkora ) , scoring six goals and 12 points . Much of Anaheim 's success was predicated on goaltender Jean @-@ Sébastien Giguère 's performance , who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP . Kariya , meanwhile , was often singled out for his lack of consistent impact throughout the playoffs . As the highest @-@ profile player on the Ducks , he drew matchups against opposing teams top defencemen during the post @-@ season , such as Willie Mitchell against the Wild and Stevens against the Devils .

These included large tracts of land beyond the temple enclosure , sometimes in a completely different region than the temple itself . The most important type of property was farmland , producing grain , fruit , or wine , or supporting herds of livestock . The temple either managed these lands directly , rented them out to farmers for a share of the produce , or managed them jointly with the royal administration . Temples also launched expeditions into the desert to collect resources such as salt , honey , or wild game , or to mine precious minerals . Some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across the country or even beyond Egypt 's borders . Thus , as Richard H. Wilkinson says , the temple estate \" often represented no less than a slice of Egypt itself \" . As a major economic center and the employer of a large part of the local population , the temple enclosure was a key part of the town in which it stood . Conversely , when a temple was founded on empty land , a new town was built to support it ."

The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel , according to a study in kinematics . Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone . They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations , such as nests , tree holes , or dense vegetation , Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations . Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation .

It took another 13 years for it to be dedicated on December 6 , 1947 . One month before the dedication of the park , the former editor of The Miami Herald and freelance writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas published her first book , The Everglades : River of Grass . After researching the region for five years , she described the history and ecology of the south of Florida in great detail , characterizing the Everglades as a river instead of a stagnant swamp . Douglas later wrote , \" My colleague Art Marshall said that with [ the words \" River of Grass \" ] I changed everybody 's knowledge and educated the world as to what the Everglades meant \" . The last chapter was titled \" The Eleventh Hour \" and warned that the Everglades were approaching death , although the course could be reversed . Its first printing sold out a month after its release ."

As a consequence , the cemetery was designed with attractiveness in mind , in contrast to the squalid and congested London burial grounds and the newer suburban cemeteries which were already becoming crowded . The LNC aimed to create an atmosphere of perpetual spring in the cemetery , and chose the plants for the cemetery accordingly . It had already been noted that evergreen plants from North America thrived in the local soil . Robert Donald , the owner of an arboretum near Woking , was contracted to supply the trees and shrubs for the cemetery . The railway line through the cemetery and the major roads and paths within the cemetery were lined with giant sequoia trees , the first significant planting of these trees ( only introduced to Europe in 1853 ) in Britain . As well as the giant sequoias , the grounds were heavily planted with magnolia , rhododendron , coastal redwood , azalea , andromeda and monkeypuzzle , with the intention of creating perpetual greenery with large numbers of flowers and a strong floral scent throughout the cemetery ."

    "text": "Since the nascent Caliphate regarded itself as the heir of the Sassanid ( and to a lesser extent , Byzantine ) tradition and \" civilizational consciousness \" , the Arab caliphs also adopted the notion that , in the words of the historian Gerald Mako , it was their duty \" to protect the settled , i.e. the civilized world from the northern barbarian \" . To this imperative was added the Muslim concept of division of the world into the \" House of Islam \" ( Dar al @-@ Islam ) and the \" House of War \" ( Dar al @-@ Harb ) , to which the pagan Turkic nomads were consigned . The two armies consequently represented two different military philosophies . While the Umayyad armies disposed of a sizeable cavalry contingent , both light and heavy , their mainstay was the infantry , to the extent that in battle the Arab cavalry was often limited to skirmishing during the initial phases , before dismounting and fighting on foot . The Khazars on the other hand , although they had adopted elements of the civilizations of the south and possessed towns , remained a largely tribal and semi @-@ nomadic power . Like their Central Asian counterparts , they practiced a highly mobile form of warfare , relying on their highly skilled and hardy cavalry . As the historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship writes , \" the Khazars were to prove difficult opponents for the Muslims , perhaps partly because their state was not highly organized and thus did not have a center whose fall would bring about a sudden collapse and rapid surrender \" . The eastern Caucasus range became the main theatre of the Arab – Khazar conflict , with the Arab armies aiming to gain control of Derbent ( known in Arabic as Bab al @-@ Abwab , \" Gate of Gates \" ) and the Khazar cities of Balanjar and Samandar , whose location has yet to be established with certainty by modern researchers . Both of the latter are referred to as Khazar capitals by different Arab writers , and may have functioned as winter and summer capitals respectively . It was only later , under the impact of the Arab attacks , that the Khazars moved their capital further north , to Atil on the mouths of the Volga ."

The few Pele @-@ type plumes that have been observed are usually associated with explosion @-@ dominated eruptions , and are short @-@ lived . The exception to this is Pele , which is associated with a long @-@ lived active lava lake eruption , though the plume is thought to be intermittent . The higher vent temperatures and pressures associated with these plumes generate eruption speeds of up to 1 kilometre per second ( 0 @.@ 62 mi / s ) , allowing them to reach heights of between 300 and 500 kilometres ( 190 and 310 mi ) .

These plumes are sometimes only seen in images acquired while Io is in the shadow of Jupiter or those taken in ultraviolet .

That is why these plumes lack the dense central column seen in Prometheus @-@ type plumes , in which dust is generated at the plume source .

Shortly after Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954 , he told Time magazine that \" this would be a good year to release poets \" .

In 1957 several publications began campaigning for his release . Le Figaro published an appeal entitled \" The Lunatic at St Elizabeths \" . The New Republic , Esquire and The Nation followed suit ; The Nation argued that Pound was a sick and vicious old man , but that he had rights . In 1958 MacLeish hired Thurman Arnold , a prestigious lawyer who ended up charging no fee , to file a motion to dismiss the 1945 indictment . Overholser , the hospital 's superintendent , supported the application with an affidavit saying Pound was permanently and incurably insane , and that confinement served no therapeutic purpose . The motion was heard on 18 April that year by the same judge who had committed Pound to St Elizabeths . The Department of Justice did not oppose the motion , and Pound was free ."

Although it has been previously indicated that nest mates may alarm the rest of the nest through jerky movement and buzzing of wings , Polistes exclamans is capable of alarming the rest of the nest and attracting attacking wasps through chemical means by releasing a non @-@ species @-@ specific venomous alarm pheromone . Although a chemical signal to warn against attack would be evolutionarily adaptive , the Polistes exclamans only releases a response post the initial attack from and on the predator , as the venom is only released during the sting . This venom is capable of warning and coordinating a response from the nest and attracting nearby heterospecific or conspecific females from nearby colonies to attack the predator . This helps deter the predator from further attacking and is especially adaptive for the defense of the nest . Although certain other insects have been able to adapt the release of the pheromone to other means of communicating alarm , Polistes exclamans has yet to do so , indicating that it is still in its “ primitive state in evolution of the complex systems of communication of alarm seen in higher social insects . ” In one experiment , pheromones were extracted from female glands and sacs and were spread onto venom paper . It was then found that females were attracted upwind of the venom paper and some even attempted to sting it . This also had a heterospecific response where others also reacted to it . While it was found that one wasp couldn ’ t release enough pheromones to elicit a response , if many individuals were alarmed they would elicit a response from the rest of the nest . However , this scent is not strong enough to reach other nests , and so neighboring nests must be alarmed by physical movements and wing flapping ."

For example , the Chinese believed that when the heart — associated with the fire phase — caused one to become sluggish , then one should eat sour food because it was associated with the wood phase ( which promoted fire ) . The Han Chinese also believed that by using pulse diagnosis , a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted \" vital energy \" ( qi ) and what qualities the latter had , in order to figure out the exact disorder the patient was suffering . Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine , Han texts also give practical advice , such as the proper way to perform clinical lancing to remove an abscess .

During jury selection , the prosecution used peremptory challenges to strike all Black and Hispanic jurors who were available for jury service .

At 16 : 30 on the 2nd , Von der Tann , along with Seydlitz ( Hipper 's flagship ) , Moltke , the armored cruiser Blücher , and the four light cruisers Strassburg , Graudenz , Kolberg , and Stralsund , departed the Jade Estuary , bound for the English coast with the intent to lay minefields in British sea lanes . At 18 : 00 , two dreadnought battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet departed to provide support . Hipper 's force veered north in an arc to avoid Heligoland and the British submarines stationed there , and then increased speed to 18 knots . At approximately 06 : 30 the following morning , Hipper 's battlecruisers spotted the British minesweeper Halcyon and opened fire , which drew the attention of the destroyer Lively . Hipper realized that he was wasting time , and that further pursuit would run his ships into a known minefield , so he ordered his ships back to sea . As the flotilla was turning away , the battlecruisers fired several salvos at Great Yarmouth , to little effect . By the time the British Admiralty was fully aware of the situation , the German force had retreated back to home waters ."

One historian writes that there is \" virtually no evidence \" that soldiers thought the death penalty unjust , although another writes that some soldiers deplored the death penalty , while most thought it justified .

Only executed men 's records survive , so it is hard to comment on the reasons why men were reprieved , but it has been suggested that the policy of commuting 90 percent of death sentences may well have been deliberate mercy in the application of military law designed for a small regular army recruited from the rougher elements of society .

Sakurai says that there were scenes that took over a year to complete , with very precise directions being given requiring multiple takes . According to Sakurai , Cloud 's silence conveys more about the character than when he speaks . While possessing heroic characteristics , Sakurai describes Cloud 's outlook as negative , and says that he is delicate in some respects . A fan of VII , Sakurai had believed Cloud to be a colder character based on his original impression of him , but later came to view him as more sentimental . After the final product was released , Sakurai was anxious to hear the fans ' response , whether positive or negative , and says that most of the feedback he received praised him . While recording Crisis Core , Sakurai felt that Cloud , though still introverted , acted more like a normal teenager , and modified his approach accordingly . Cloud 's scream over Zack 's death left a major impression on Sakurai , who says that he worked hard to convey the emotional tone of the ending .

Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and Illinois , Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value . Detroit was twenty miles ( 32 km ) up the Detroit River from Lake Erie , and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south . Because of this , Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals , and later railroads , than was Toledo . From this perspective on the rapidly developing Midwest of the 1820s and 1830s , both states had much to gain by controlling the land in the Toledo Strip ."

The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later . Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species . In some , the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others , the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus .

This is due to the greater size of the P3 − and As3 − ions , so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form . These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals : for example , potassium has nine different known phosphides , with formulae K3P , K4P3 , K5P4 , KP , K4P6 , K3P7 , K3P11 , KP10.3 , and KP15 . While most metals form arsenides , only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides . The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na – Na distances of 328 – 330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal , and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic . Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known , such as LiAs , which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding . The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3 − ion is a strong reducing agent ; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine ( SbH3 ) . Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic ; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds ."

Following the Indian @-@ Asian collision , the fault type changed from a strike @-@ slip fault to a normal fault , and seafloor spreading created compression along the Davie Fracture Zone , causing it to rise .

The University of Tübingen Sinologist and historian Hans Ulrich Vogel argued that Polo 's description of paper money and salt production supported his presence in China because he included details which he could not have otherwise known . Economic historian Mark Elvin , in his preface to Vogel 's 2013 monograph , concludes that Vogel \" demonstrates by specific example after specific example the ultimately overwhelming probability of the broad authenticity \" of Polo 's account .

For example , plasma weapons need time to cool if fired too rapidly , but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries , whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat , but require reloading and ammunition . In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games , Halo players may carry only two weapons at once , calling for strategy when managing firearms ."

Scharnhorst was closer and therefore fired first . Six minutes after opening fire , Scharnhorst scored a hit at a range of 24 @,@ 100 m ( 26 @,@ 400 yd ) . The shell struck the carrier 's upper hangar and started a large fire . Less than ten minutes later , a shell from Gneisenau struck the bridge and killed Glorious 's captain . The two destroyers attempted to cover Glorious with smoke screens , but the German battleships could track the carrier with their radar . By 18 : 26 the range had fallen to 25 @,@ 600 m ( 28 @,@ 000 yd ) , and Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were firing full salvos at the carrier . After approximately an hour of shooting , the German battleships sent Glorious to the bottom . They also sank the two destroyers . Before sinking one of them , Acasta , managed to hit Scharnhorst with a torpedo at 18 : 39 . Acasta also hit Scharnhorst 's forward superfiring turret with her 4 @.@ 7 \" QF guns , which did negligible damage . The torpedo hit caused serious damage ; it tore a hole 14 by 6 m ( 15 @.@ 3 by 6 @.@ 6 yd ) and allowed 2 @,@ 500 t ( 2 @,@ 500 long tons ; 2 @,@ 800 short tons ) of water into the ship . The rear turret was disabled and 48 men were killed . The flooding caused a 5 degree list , increased the stern draft by almost a meter , and forced Scharnhorst to reduce speed to 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The ship 's machinery was also significantly damaged by the flooding , and the starboard propeller shaft was destroyed ."

Once enough lightning @-@ chakra has been collected , the user rushes at their target and thrusts the Chidori into it ; the speed of the attack and the amount of chakra used enable the user to penetrate most defenses easily . During Kakashi Gaiden , a short flashback to Kakashi 's childhood that divides Part I and II of the series , the Chidori is revealed to cause a tunnel vision effect because of the speeds at which the user moves , leaving them vulnerable to a counterattack . Because of this disability , only ninja with a Sharingan eye can use the Chidori effectively , as the Sharingan 's ability to notice even the slightest details counteracts the tunnel vision . As a result , Kakashi is able to teach the Chidori to Sasuke Uchiha during Part I."

During the 1920 legislative session , the Republicans held a majority in the state House of Representatives and were a minority by only two votes in the state Senate . During the session , Morrow was often able to convince C. W. Burton , a Democratic senator from Grant County , to support Republican proposals . Tie votes in the Senate were broken by Republican lieutenant governor S. Thruston Ballard . Consequently , Morrow was able to effect a considerable reorganization of the state government , including replacing the Board of Control with a nonpartisan Board of Charities and Corrections , centralizing highway works , and revising property taxes . He oversaw improvements to the education system , including better textbook selection and a tax on racetracks to support a minimum salary for teachers . Among Morrow 's reforms that did not pass was a proposal to make the judiciary nonpartisan ."

Internally , there are also strong visual similarities in the simple lancet windows of the east end and the contrasting profusion of Purbeck marble shafts .

The Ursa Major Group is a set of 220 stars that share a common motion through space and were once formed as members of an open cluster , which has since become gravitationally unbound . However , analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius 's membership in the group to be questionable : the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500 ± 100 million years , whereas Sirius , with metallicity similar to the Sun 's , has an age that is only half this , making it too young to belong to the group .

In this arrangement , B. dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia , because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia 's characteristic flower spikes , section Banksia because of its straight styles , and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical . There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to . Alf Salkin had noted that B. dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus . Unlike southern banksias , it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves . Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences . In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 , Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B. plagiocarpa , B. robur and B. oblongifolia within the series Salicinae . These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike . It was held to be most closely related to B. robur on account of its large undulate leaves . Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B. dentata , B. robur and B. oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear , suggesting a close relationship . However , this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George ; he discounted a close relationship with B. robur , which he felt was too distinctive .

However , in 1893 it was split from Myiarchus into the new , monotypic genus Deltarhynchus by Robert Ridgway because of its shorter and broader bill , more rounded wings , and partially streaked underparts . This change was upheld in 1901 by Richard Bowdler Sharpe and by subsequent authors . However , in 1977 ornithologist Melvin Alvah Traylor Jr . , while upholding its status as a monotypic genus , said that the species should be lumped back into Myiarchus if its nesting habits were similar to those of that genus . These doubts were put to rest by Wesley Lanyon 's research of the flycatcher in 1979 , which confirmed the bird 's placement in a monotypic genus ."

    "text": "The broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is attachment theory , based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by John Bowlby , Mary Ainsworth and René Spitz . Attachment theory is a framework that employs psychological , ethological and evolutionary concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children . Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to seek proximity to a particular attachment figure ( familiar caregiver ) , in situations of alarm or distress , behavior which appears to have survival value . This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment . Subsequently , the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment , returning periodically to the familiar person . Attachment is not the same as love and / or affection although they are often associated . Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years . Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant , and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time . Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment , that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual 's feelings , thoughts , and expectations in later relationships . For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder , the child 's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment ."

In this role he is best known for his public building program in Rome , and completing the construction of the Colosseum in 80 , but also for his generosity in relieving the suffering caused by two disasters , the Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 , and the fire of Rome of 80 . Titus continued his father 's efforts to promote the Flavian dynasty . He revived practice of the imperial cult , deified his father , and laid foundations for what would later become the Temple of Vespasian and Titus , which was finished by Domitian . After barely two years in office , Titus unexpectedly died of a fever on September 13 , 81 , and was deified by the Roman Senate ."

The team disregarded San Andreas as a departure point for Grand Theft Auto V because they had moved on to a new generation of consoles and wanted to build the city from scratch . According to Garbut , with the move to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware , \" our processes and the fidelity of the world [ had ] evolved so much from San Andreas \" that using it as a model would have been redundant . The team focused their efforts on one city instead of three and were able to produce Los Santos in higher quality and at greater scale than in the previous game ."

    "text": "All these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation . The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force , or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel . Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction : upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight , and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force . The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic . Beyond the tropics , the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction , and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force . Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic . Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance , one can derive the thermal wind relation : the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient . If two air masses , one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South , are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed , the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass . The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward @-@ moving mass to deviate to the East , while equatorward @-@ moving mass will deviate toward the west . The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction . As a result , winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude . Therefore , the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the Equator is warmer than the North and South poles ."

The victor , William II Rufus , granted the city to a royal physician , John of Tours , who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath . Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey 's grounds from the king , as well as the city of Bath itself . Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear . The abbey had recently lost its abbot , Ælfsige , and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city ; it was likely the abbey 's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery . By acquiring Bath , John also acquired the mint that was in the city . In 1090 he transferred the seat , or administration , of the bishopric to Bath Abbey , probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see . Bath was a rich abbey , and Wells had always been a poor diocese . By taking over the abbey , John increased his episcopal revenues . William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey , but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns . When John moved his episcopal seat , he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter , turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese . John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath , which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray 's rebellions .

    "text": "Engine number 4 suffered only minor , external damage . It was dismantled by the investigation team in an attempt to determine why it might have been shut down by the crew . A substantial amount of corrosion product was found in the passages of the fuel flow meter on engine number 4 . Western Australia 's Deputy Mineralogist identified the corrosion product as magnesium hydroxide . This is a corrosion product formed by reaction of magnesium and water , suggesting the fuel passages had been filled with water in the months between the crash and the detailed examination of the engine . Charles Gibbs , an engine specialist employed by the Department of Civil Aviation , estimated at least 45 cubic centimetres of water must have been involved . Rain falling on the crash site before engine number 4 was removed could not account for this much water in the fuel passages . Gibbs first examined the fuel system of engine number 4 and discovered the corrosion about two months after the accident . He conducted a test on an identical flow meter and found that after he left water in the fuel flow passages for approximately 8 weeks a similar amount of corrosion product developed . This suggested the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground may have been caused by water in the fuel reaching engine number 4 . The steel rotor in the fuel pump of engine number 1 was slightly corroded but the fuel systems of engines 2 and 3 showed no evidence of corrosion . Investigators formed the opinion that the rough running heard by witnesses on the ground , and the crew 's decision to shut down engine number 4 and feather its propeller , may have been related to water in the fuel reaching that engine . Similarly , the intermittent loss of power on all engines in the final minutes of the flight may indicate that all engines were receiving fuel contaminated with water ."

When following a physical breakdown in 1923 Holst gave up his duties at Morley College , Joseph wrote him a supportive letter congratulating him on his decision which would enable him to concentrate on composition . The following years were particularly fruitful for Holst , and Joseph assisted in many of the works he produced in the 1924 – 28 period . She helped him prepare the score for his Choral Symphony , for which assistance he presented her with his original draft sketches , as a gesture of gratitude . Together with Lasker and Day she worked to prepare vocal and full scores for the opera At the Boar 's Head , and attended the rehearsals in March 1925 . After the opera 's premiere on 3 April she wrote to Holst with mildly critical comments on some of the singers , though with praise for the conductor , the young Malcolm Sargent . When Holst composed a short choral piece to celebrate the 21st birthday of the Oriana Madrigal Society , Joseph provided words which humorously reflected the conductor Kennedy Scott 's working methods ; the work was greatly appreciated by the choir . In that same year , 1925 , she helped to found the Kensington Choral Society . By this time the Joseph home in Kensington , where Jane lived for her whole life , was becoming a recognised musical gathering @-@ place ; a visitor recalled meeting Vaughan Williams , Boult , and the harpist Sidonie Goossens there , among others ."

Largely indifferent to party discipline and official policy , among wider causes he championed were disarmament and Welsh nationalism , with a persistence that brought him several suspensions from the party and helped to ensure that he was never offered ministerial office . An immensely popular figure locally , he was regularly returned at general elections with large majorities . In 1966 , after an unstable colliery spoil tip collapsed on the village of Aberfan with the loss of 144 lives , Davies controversially stated that he had long thought that the tip was unsafe . He had not reported his suspicions , for fear that an enquiry would cause the closures of local pits . Not long after his unexpected 1970 electoral triumph , Davies died early in 1972 aged at least 85 and possibly 90 or more ."

The Jersey Shore and Coudersport Turnpike was constructed along the wagon path between 1825 and 1834 , and tolls were collected for travel on the road until 1860 . The park is in West Branch Township , which was incorporated from Eulalia Township in 1856 . A post office was opened at Edgcomb 's Clearing in 1873 ; the locals petitioned the United States Post Office to change the name to \" Cherryville \" , for a nearby group of Black Cherry trees . However , since there was already a Cherryville , Pennsylvania , post office in Lehigh Township in Northampton County , the name \" Cherry Spring \" was chosen as a compromise .

By virtue of this position , McNicoll was head of the Naval Board and the functional commander of the RAN . McNicoll 's term as CNS was characterised by a period of heightened activity for the RAN in light of the Australian commitments to the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi and the Vietnam War . He furthermore had to oversee an extensive modernisation of the fleet , with the introduction into service of the Perth @-@ class destroyers , Attack @-@ class patrol boats , and the initial batch of Oberon @-@ class submarines . The Fleet Air Arm was also re @-@ equipped with American fixed wing aircraft . Despite these acquisitions , the RAN possessed a rather thin and limited fleet during this period , which McNicoll blamed on past naval planning . He criticised the lack of foresight in earlier decisions that had led to \" inconsistencies and inadequate estimating \" in the future needs of the RAN , which had consequently left the fleet outdated and minimal . In addition to the RAN 's materiel issues , McNicoll faced significant problems with morale and recruitment . A series of mishaps and accidents over the previous decade led to what naval historian Tom Frame termed as \" an appreciable erosion of public confidence in the navy 's professional standards \" . The situation intensified following the February 1964 collision between HMAS Melbourne and Voyager . The two subsequent Royal Commissions into the incident subjected the RAN to unprecedented scrutiny and damaged the public perception of its senior leadership . McNicoll had to cope with the turmoil occasioned by these events and concerned himself with the restoration of morale in the Navy ."

It was first used in 1932 by Wilhelm Biltz 's group at the University of Hanover , where it was proposed by Werner Fischer .

A piezoelectric transducer , in essence , is made simply by plating electrodes on to the piezoelectric material . Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as barium titanate had poor temperature stability . This precluded the transducer from functioning as one of the resonators ; it had to be a separate component . This problem was solved with the introduction of lead zirconate titanate ( abbreviated PZT ) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator . Another common piezoelectric material is quartz , which has also been used in mechanical filters .

    "text": "By 1895 , Lloyd 's risqué songs were receiving frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential feminists . As a result , she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career . The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant , who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance , disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances , and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes . Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square , as part of the licensing conditions . The screens were unpopular and protesters , among them the young Winston Churchill , later pulled them down . That November at the Tivoli theatre , Lloyd performed \" Johnny Jones \" , a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend . The song , although not lyrically obscene , was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it , adding winks and gestures , and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience . Social reformers cited \" Johnny Jones \" as being offensive , but less so compared to other songs of the day . Upon the expiry of a music hall 's entertainments licence , the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal . As a result , Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee . She sang \" Oh ! Mr Porter \" ( composed for her by George Le Brunn ) , \" A Little of What You Fancy \" and \" She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas \" , which she retitled \" I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks \" after some protest . The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss . Feeling disgruntled at the council 's interference , she then rendered Alfred Tennyson 's drawing @-@ room ballad \" Come into the Garden , Maud \" and displayed leers and nudges , to illustrate each innuendo . The committee were left stunned at the performance , but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was \" all in the mind \" ."

Nelson focused his flagship 's fire on Spartiate , while Captain Thomas Louis in Minotaur attacked the unengaged Aquilon and Captain John Peyton in Defence joined the attack on Peuple Souverain . With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered , the following British ships , HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic , passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre . Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage .

In Woolf 's story Shakespeare 's sister is denied the education of her brother despite her obvious talent . When her father tries to marry her off , she runs away to join a theatre company but is ultimately rejected because of her gender . She becomes pregnant , is abandoned by her partner , and commits suicide . Woolf 's Judith was created in an attempt to fill a historical gap . Woolf intended to make a point about the struggle that a female poet and playwright would have had in the Elizabethan age . Woolf speculated as to why there were so few talented women from that time . \" What I find deplorable , \" she observed , \" is that nothing is known about women before the eighteenth century . \""

The smoke and fumes from these hits caused SMS Derfflinger to lose sight of Lion , which had sheered out of line to starboard , and to switch her fire to Queen Mary , now visible to Derfflinger 's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal , at 16 : 16 .

Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar , it was not the other way around : \" We want to do a film with you , \" said Jobs . \" That would make us happy . \" At this same time , Peter Schneider , president of Walt Disney Feature Animation , was potentially interested in making a feature film with Pixar . When Catmull , Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Schneider in the summer of 1990 , they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious . They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar , it would be outside Schneider 's purview , which aggravated Schneider . After that first meeting , the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and were surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference . Catmull , Smith and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves ( head of animation research and development ) , Jobs , and Lasseter .

The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal rigidity , sudden high fever , and altered mental status ; however , all three features are present in only 44 – 46 % of bacterial meningitis cases . If none of the three signs are present , acute meningitis is extremely unlikely . Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include photophobia ( intolerance to bright light ) and phonophobia ( intolerance to loud noises ) . Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms , and may only be irritable and look unwell . The fontanelle ( the soft spot on the top of a baby 's head ) can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months . Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain , cold extremities , and an abnormal skin color ."

In the ' dagger scene ' and the duet following the murder of Duncan , the forms transcend the ' Code Rossini ' and propel the drama in a compelling fashion . Verdi was to comment in 1868 that Rossini and his followers missed \" the golden thread that binds all the parts together and , rather than a set of numbers without coherence , makes an opera . \" Tinta was for Verdi this \" golden thread \" , an essential unifying factor in his works ."

In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis , a number of species perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side ; this is thought to mimic the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze .

The challenge to England came from Richard Mullock of Newport , who was not an official of the South Wales Football Union , but wanted to bring Wales up to the same level as the other home nations , rather than settle for playing against English and Irish provincial teams . England , for its part , had recently beaten Ireland by two tries and two goals to none , and the previous season had become the first winners of the Calcutta Cup by beating Scotland by three tries and two goals to one goal . The date offered to Mullock by the English Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) , 19 February , coincided with a match for the South Wales Cup between Llanelli and cup holders Swansea , thereby limiting Mullock 's selection options .

The taxes were initially collected in the form of ivory but when ivory supplies began to run low the Free State switched to natural rubber . The rubber was collected from Landolphia owariensis gentilii rubber vines which were relatively scarce in the area with an average frequency of around one plant in each acre . The rubber was gathered by tapping a rubber vine and placing a pot beneath to collect the latex which could be used in the production of rubber for the European market . If the vines were a long distance from the ground the gatherer would have had to climb a tree , tap the plant and hold the collecting pot beneath the vine , possibly for an entire day . Hence rubber collection was a labour @-@ intensive process which made it unpopular with the villagers . Indeed , they preferred the Manyema to the Free State authorities as the Manyema only took low bulk , high value items such as ivory or slaves because of the long distances from their homeland whereas the state , with its steamboat transports , could afford to make the people harvest the low value high bulk rubber . By September 1892 the Free State was using its military forces to attack and occupy villages in the Lulonga and Maringa river valleys to expand its tax base ."

His recommendation that American labor and facilities be established in the United Kingdom to handle the repair , assembly , and equipping of American aircraft created a stir on both sides of the Atlantic , and was ultimately disapproved by Arnold on the grounds that the personnel and equipment were not available . Brett next paid a visit to the Middle East where his outspoken criticism of arrangements there antagonised his hosts to the extent that the British Ambassador to Egypt , Sir Miles Lampson , complained about him to the Foreign Secretary , Sir Anthony Eden . Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder noted that \" the charms of General Brett ’ s company were beginning to pall . After a talk with him on the afternoon of 25 September I wondered in my journal how he and all the American visitors could lay down the law about things of which they knew next to nothing . \" As a result , Brett was ordered to return to the United States in December ."

    "text": "The method was developed by Willard Libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists . Libby received the Nobel Prize for his work in 1960 . The radiocarbon dating method is based on the fact that radiocarbon is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen . The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide , which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis ; animals then acquire 14C by eating the plants . When the animal or plant dies , it stops exchanging carbon with its environment , and from that point onwards the amount of 14C it contains begins to decrease as the 14C undergoes radioactive decay . Measuring the amount of 14C in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides information that can be used to calculate when the animal or plant died . The older a sample is , the less 14C there is to be detected , and because the half @-@ life of 14C ( the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed ) is about 5 @,@ 730 years , the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by radiocarbon dating are around 50 @,@ 000 years ago , although special preparation methods occasionally permit dating of older samples ."

An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic , which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers . Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings , but Noether found a unique factorization theorem , now called the Lasker – Noether theorem , for the ideals of many rings . Much of Noether 's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings , in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems , and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings ."

Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available , such as the formation of algal ( and cyanobacterial ) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer .

Len Hutton and Bill Edrich — two of England 's leading batsmen — had seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket . Tallon declared to Bradman that he intended to dismiss Hutton down the leg side , so Bradman brought off spinner Ian Johnson into the attack immediately after lunch . Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton 's legs to give him an opportunity to glance the ball . Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat , expecting a boundary .

Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a cut shot which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson , fielding at slip , in the chest . The ball rebounded past Tallon 's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed . According to Roland Perry , it was \" an acrobatic feat that would put any trapeze artist in the shade , taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history \" . Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4 / 99 , with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches .

Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time , this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position , especially a position near where the electron was bound in space , for which the electron wave equations did not change in time . This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics ( the first being by Heisenberg in 1925 ) , and solutions of Schrödinger 's equation , like Heisenberg 's , provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913 , and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum . Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were considered , quantum mechanics later made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with higher atomic numbers than hydrogen ."

Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter , hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier , but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance . Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her , but she soon returned and married Hunt ."

Actors , minstrels , and British clowns inspired by Juba and other minstrels adopted blackface and performed dances similar to Juba 's as a stage character called the \" Gay Negro Boy \" . The character spread to France ( from 1860 ) and Belgium ( from 1865 ) when British circuses toured there . Elements of these dances were still found among British whiteface clowns as late as the 1940s . Juba 's rave reception in Manchester may have presaged that city 's later status as the center of dance in the United Kingdom .

In this case , \" Planned Parenthood \" was the Southeast Pennsylvania Chapter , and \" Casey \" was Robert Casey , the governor of Pennsylvania . The ultimate ruling was split , and Roe v. Wade was narrowed but upheld in an opinion written by Sandra Day O 'Connor , Anthony Kennedy , and David Souter . Harry Blackmun and John Paul Stevens concurred with the main decision in separately written opinions . The Supreme Court struck down spousal consent requirements for married women to obtain abortions , but found no \" undue burden \" — an alternative to strict scrutiny , which tests the allowable limitations on rights protected under the Constitution — from the other statutory requirements . Dissenting were William Rehnquist , Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , and Byron White . Blackmun , Rehnquist , and White were the only justices who voted on the original Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 who were still on the Supreme Court to rule on this case , and their votes on this case were consistent with their votes on the original decision that legalized abortion . Only Blackmun voted to maintain Roe v. Wade in its entirety ."

Soter went on to propose a parameter he called the planetary discriminant , designated with the symbol µ ( mu ) , that represents an experimental measure of the actual degree of cleanliness of the orbital zone ( where µ is calculated by dividing the mass of the candidate body by the total mass of the other objects that share its orbital zone ) , where µ > 100 is deemed to be cleared .

In his early films , he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues ( The Virginian ) . After becoming a major star , his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas ( A Farewell to Arms ) . During the height of his career , from 1936 to 1943 , he played a new type of hero — a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others ( Mr. Deeds , Meet John Doe , and For Whom the Bell Tolls ) . In the post @-@ war years , Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image , which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone ( The Fountainhead and High Noon ) .

He chose the actual removal of children from the home at this particular time because it was a specific event , the effects of which could be studied , and because he believed it could have serious effects on a child 's development and because it was preventable . In addition , views that he had already expressed about the importance of a child 's real life experiences and relationship with carers had been met by \" sheer incredulity \" by colleagues before World War II . This led him to see that far more systematic knowledge was required of the effects on a child of early experiences . Bowlby and his colleagues were pioneers of the view that studies involving direct observation of infants and children were not merely of interest but were essential to the advancement of science in this area ."

    "text": "Once a droplet has frozen , it grows in the supersaturated environment , which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point . The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air ( vapor ) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected . Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance , the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets . This process is known as the Wegener – Bergeron – Findeisen process . The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate , meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets ' expense . These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation , since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass , and may collide and stick together in clusters , or aggregates . These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground . Guinness World Records list the world 's largest ( aggregate ) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh , Montana ; allegedly one measured 15 inches ( 38 cm ) wide .
