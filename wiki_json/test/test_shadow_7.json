    "text": "The Anonimalle Chronicle gives a clear account of the unrest in East Anglia . On hearing of the rebellion , Henry le Despenser acted swiftly , moving through Cambridgeshire , Suffolk and Norfolk from his home in Burley , Rutland . His armed force initially consisted of his personal retinue , but ultimately became a much larger force consisting of many knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels . According to the historian Edgar Powell , Henry Dispenser undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels . He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere , before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge . The authorities were alerted to the call in Norfolk for men to join the revolt in the name of Litster . On 17 June the rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath , outside Norwich : shortly afterwards , Sir Robert Salle , who had come out of the city to speak with the commons , was killed . According to Thomas Walsingham , the knight died soon after he was ' knocked on the head by a rustic who was one of his own serfs ' . The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc , destroying property and killing several prominent citizens . Other houses and church properties within the county ( such as at Yarmouth ) were attacked by the rebels at this time ."

In the course of the war , North suffered damage to his waterworks , and one of his ships was sunk . However he also befriended the Chilean Admiral Patricio Lynch who later supported him in his business ventures . During the war , North was assisted by two British men : Robert Harvey , who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates ( saltpetre ) industry , and John Dawson , a banker . North was able to use Harvey 's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru 's poor military performance during the war . After the war , the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields , perhaps influenced by appeals from North 's friends . North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds . The reason that the Chilean government allowed this is that it would have cost them GBP £ 4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators . By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates ."

When the subtropical ridge shifts due to ENSO , so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks . Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September – November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years , while mainland China experiences much greater landfall frequency during La Niña years . During El Niño years , the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130 ° E , which would favor the Japanese archipelago , while in La Niña years the formation of tropical cyclones , along with the subtropical ridge position , shift west , which increases the threat to China . In the Atlantic basin , the subtropical ridge position tends to lie about 5 degrees farther south during El Niño years , which leads to a more southerly recurvature for tropical cyclones during those years ."

At altitudes 90 – 150 km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet , with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere . The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air , which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90 – 120 km .

Earlier , when checking whether Pinchbeck had stolen funds from the bank , the manager had told Mulder they would need his badge number and thumb print to gain access to the Electronic Fund Transfer ( EFT ) system . Mulder shows Scully Maleeni 's wallet , which he had collected from evidence before confronting him and LaBonge . When the agents first met LaBonge , he had surreptitiously pickpocketed their badges as an example of his skill with sleight of hand , which gave him Mulder 's badge number . Upon their first meeting with Pinchbeck impersonating his brother , Pinchbeck did a card trick with Mulder , leaving Mulder 's prints on the card , which as Mulder displays , is securely in Maleeni 's wallet . Mulder explains that the pair purposely acted in a high profile manner to draw the attention of the FBI , and that if they had collected the badge number and thumbprint , they would have been able to perform EFTs . As Mulder and Scully leave the jail , Scully shows that she , too , has learned a trick , and turns her hand around 360 degrees in a similar fashion as LaBonge had done with his hand before . Mulder asks Scully to explain how , and she brushes him off , saying simply \" magic \" ."

According to the edicts , these kingdoms lay outside the southern boundary of the Mauryan Empire . The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga King , Kharavela , ( c . 150 BCE ) refers to the arrival of a tribute of jewels and elephants from the Pandyan king . It also talks about a league of Tamil kingdoms that had been in existence 113 years before then . The earliest epigraphic records of the Tamil country in Tamil Nadu were found in Mangulam village near Madurai . The cave inscriptions , deciphered in 1966 , have been dated to 2nd century BC and record the gift of a monastery by Pandyan king Nedunj Cheliyan to a Jain monk . These inscriptions are also the oldest Jain inscriptions in South India and among the oldest in all of India . References to Sangam age Chera dynasty are found in Tamil @-@ Brahmi inscriptions of 3rd century CE found on rocks in Edakal hill in Wynad district of Kerala . The ancient port city of Thondi is mentioned in inscriptions found in Kilavalavu village near Madurai . The early part of the 20th century saw the discovery of about 39 inscriptions in a dozen locations , all near Madurai . The most significant of these were the ones at Alagarmalai and Sittannavasal . The Alagarmalai inscriptions , dated to the 1st century BCE , record the endowments made by a group of merchants from Madurai . Another set of inscriptions from the 2nd century CE , found at Pugalur village near Karur , document the construction of a rock shelter by a Chera king of the Irumporai line for a Jain monk , Cenkayapan . Cave inscriptions at Arachalur , dated to the 4th century , provide evidence for the cultivation of music and dance in the Tamil country . One of the earliest inscriptional evidence of the chieftains of the Sangam age was found at Jambai , a village near the town of Tirukkoyilur in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu . These inscriptions belonging to the 1st century CE record the grants made by the chieftain Atiyaman Netuman Anci who ruled from Takatur . According to epigraphist I. Mahadevan , there were some reservations initially , about the linguistic details in the inscriptions , but further investigations have confirmed their authenticity . Inscriptions from the 2nd century CE found at Mannarkoil village in Tirunelveli district contain a reference to a katikai , which could mean an assembly of learned persons or an institution of higher learning . An inscription belonging to the early Cholas has been discovered near Tiruchirappalli and has been dated between the 2nd and 4th century .

After independence , trade among the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period . Once the ties were broken , the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns . In addition , the protection against European competition , which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy , ended .

For Creid , he expanded on this theme to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style . The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks , and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces . The album 's title refers to two ideas , with one being \" a message to those who feel they have lost sight of their ambitions for the flood of information this era surrounds us with \" and the other an affirmation to himself that Mitsuda had \" rediscovered [ his ] own path \" . Mitsuda felt that with this album , he had \" discovered the precise mode of musical expression [ he ] was seeking within \" himself and \" given form to the belief within [ his ] heart \" ."

For example , if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems , then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems . Mendel 's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently in the production of gametes , or germ cells , ensuring variation in the next generation .

Maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 110 – 120 mph ( 180 – 190 km / h ) . The strong winds knocked out communication lines , preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island , though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio . Electric power was later restored , allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm . Sugar cane , the island country 's main source of revenue , was severely damaged , with losses estimated to be in excess of $ 1 million . Poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds . An estimated 8 @,@ 100 homes were damaged by the hurricane .

Only the ring @-@ tailed lemur , the bamboo lemurs ( genus Hapalemur ) , and the black @-@ and @-@ white ruffed lemur ( Varecia variegata ) are known to consume herbs . While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity , these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs . One possible reason for this is that ferns lack flowers , fruits , and seeds — common food items in lemur diets . They also occur close to the ground , while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees . Lastly , ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds . Likewise , mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content . Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses , however , such as tannins and alkaloids . The golden bamboo lemur ( Hapalemur aureus ) , for instance , eats giant bamboo ( Cathariostachys madagascariensis ) , which contains high levels of cyanide . This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis ; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown .

Even though men dominated the profession in earlier times , there has been a feminization of the nursing profession over the course of the last century which has caused men in nursing to often be portrayed as misfits by the media . A common stereotype is that of a man who accepts a career in nursing as an unfortunate secondary career choice , either failing to become a physician or still trying to become one . Such stereotyping is due to a presumption that a man would prefer to be a physician but is unable to become one due to lack of intelligence or non @-@ masculine attributes . Jack Byrnes is often seen openly criticizing Greg 's career choice per his perception of nursing being an effeminate profession . In their book Men in Nursing : History , Challenges , and Opportunities authors Chad O 'Lynn and Russell Tranbarger present this as an example of a negative portrayal . Commenting on the same issue but disagreeing , Barbara Cherry in her book Contemporary Nursing : Issues , Trends , & Management called the portrayal of Greg as a nurse \" one of the most positive film portrayals of men who are nurses \" and commented that Greg \" humorously addresses and rises above the worst of all stereotypes that are endured by men in this profession . \" Sandy and Harry Summers in the book Saving Lives : Why the Media 's Portrayal of Nurses Puts Us All at Risk postulate that Greg 's character , although intelligent and firm in his defense of his profession , \" might have done more to rebut the stereotypes \" while also reporting that \" some men in nursing \" expressed their opinions that it would have been better to not present the stereotypes at all ."

They held power for a while , and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution .

The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K – Pg boundary , and a small , gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous .

The Germans launched their great attack of 1940 through the same region , with Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt in command then as he was once again in this campaign . His goal was to separate the American forces from the British and Canadian forces , and take the important port city of Antwerp . By late afternoon the Germans had 14 divisions operating in the Ardennes , but this number would swell to an estimated 25 divisions , with 600 tanks and 1 @,@ 000 aircraft . The 106th Division , located in the most exposed positions along the corps line , and the 28th Division took the brunt of the attack . Middleton , headquartered in Bastogne , was awakened by a guard and could hear the guns from there . Throughout the day , the 106th was able to hold its position , but additional German units poured in during the night . Much of the 106th was on the German side of the Our River in an area known as the Schnee Eifel . The division 's commander , Major General Alan Jones , called Middleton , concerned about his two regiments east of the river . The conversation was interrupted by another call , and then resumed . At the end of the conversation Middleton told an aide that he had given his approval to have the two regiments pull back to the west side of the river . Jones , on the other hand was convinced that Middleton had directed these units to stay , and was further convinced of this based on a written order from earlier in the day , but just received . As a result of the miscommunication , the pullback did not occur , and the two regiments were ultimately surrounded with most of the men captured on 17 December . While two of the 28th Division 's regiments survived the German onslaught intact , the 110th Infantry Regiment , commanded by Colonel Hurley Fuller , was directly in the path of the massive advance . On 17 December Fuller counterattacked , but his lone regiment was up against three German divisions , and when Fuller 's command post was attacked his escape was thwarted and he was taken prisoner . Middleton next heard from him in April when he was released . Though the 110th Regiment was shattered , the stubborn resistance given by them and other VIII Corps units greatly slowed down the German timetable ."

He suggests that formal education lasts too long , teaches the wrong social class values , and increasingly damages students over time . Goodman writes that the school reflects the misguided and insincere values of its society and thus school reformers should focus on these values before schools . He proposes a variety of alternatives to school including no school , the city or farm as school , apprenticeships , guided travel , and youth organizations .

One hundred and five people participated , including members of the Ghadar Party , the former German Consul @-@ General and Vice @-@ Consul , and other members of staff of the German consulate in San Francisco . The trial itself lasted from 20 November 1917 to 24 April 1918 .

Singh himself was immediately shot dead by a US Marshal . In May 1917 , eight Indian nationalists of the Ghadar Party were indicted by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to form a military enterprise against Britain . In later years the proceedings were criticised as being a largely show trial designed to preempt any suggestions that the United States was joining an imperialist war . The jury during the trial was carefully selected to exclude any Irish person with republican views or associations . Strong public support in favour of the Indians , especially the revived Anglophobic sentiments following the colonial provisions of the Treaty of Versailles , allowed the Ghadarite movement to be revived despite British concerns ."

Historians have traditionally considered that ancient Greek women , particularly in Classical Athens , lacked economic influence . Athenian women were forbidden from entering a contract worth more than a medimnos of barley , enough to feed an average family for six days . In at least one instance , however , an Athenian woman dealt with a significantly larger sum and Deborah Lyons writes that the existence of such a law has \" recently come under question \" . Despite this , there is no evidence that Athenian women owned land or slaves ( the two most valuable forms of property ) ."

After the episode aired , the question \" Who is Mysterion ? \" became a frequently asked question at the FAQ for the official South Park website , South Park Studios . The answer posted at that site was that \" there is no answer \" , and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know . Parker said it was one of the most common questions he was asked about the show , along with the identity of Cartman 's father , which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode \" 201 \" . Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion 's identity , as they never chose a specific character to be him . In the original ending of the episode , after Mysterion is arrested , Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero . However , the real Mysterion visits him , and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime . As a thank you , Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face , but like in the actual episode , the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats . The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion . The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu @-@ ray sets . The superhero characters from \" The Coon \" returned in the fourteenth season episodes \" Coon 2 : Hindsight \" , \" Mysterion Rises \" and \" Coon vs. Coon and Friends \" , in which Mysterion is revealed ."

Anderson , perhaps falsely , implicated Quantrill in a murder , leading to the latter 's arrest by Confederate authorities . Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri as the leader of a group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state , killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri . Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil , Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified , possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces . In September 1864 , he led a raid on Centralia , Missouri . Unexpectedly , they were able to capture a passenger train , the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so . In what became known as the Centralia Massacre , possibly the war 's deadliest and most brutal guerrilla action , his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day that killed more than 100 Union militiamen . A month later , Anderson was killed in battle . Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson : some see him as a sadistic , psychopathic killer , but for others , his actions cannot be separated from the general lawlessness of the time ."

She also read Oswald Spengler 's Decline of the West , however she rejected Spengler 's pessimistic view that this decline was terminal , instead opining that the Aryan civilization could be rejuvenated through its adoption of a new religion - Odinism . She deemed Odinism to be a religion that had a natural and intrinsic relationship with what she perceived to be a Northern European race , stating that the \" primary source \" of the faith was \" biological : its genesis is in our race , its principles encoded in our genes . \" She also believed that this Odinism should use Norse names for the deities rather than Anglo @-@ Saxon or Teutonic ones in order to avoid the post @-@ war animosity between England and Germany ."

It was becoming difficult to recruit enough soldiers for the army , inflation was becoming an issue , and on at least one occasion , the Empire almost went bankrupt . The most significant constitutional development during this era was the steady drift towards monarchy . M. Cocceius Nerva succeeded Domitian , and although his reign was too short for any major constitutional reforms , he did reverse some of his predecessor 's abuses . He was succeeded by Trajan in 98 , who then went further than even Nerva had in restoring the image of a free republic , by , for example , allowing the senate to regain some independent legislative abilities . Hadrian succeeded Trajan as Emperor . By far , his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus , which included a fixed gradation of clearly defined offices , and a corresponding order of promotion . Hadrian was succeed by Antonius Pius , who made no real changes to the constitution . Antonius Pius was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius in 161 . The most significant constitutional development that occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius was the revival of the republican principle of collegiality , as he made his brother , L.

Strafford 's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue , but had done so by heavy @-@ handedly imposing order . He had trained up a large Catholic army in support of the king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament , while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement at the same time as promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians . As a result , all three groups had become disaffected . Strafford 's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him . In a similar manner to the English Parliament , the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles . They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors , and that , moreover , a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance . Strafford 's fall from power weakened Charles 's influence in Ireland . The dissolution of the Irish army was unsuccessfully demanded three times by the English Commons during Strafford 's imprisonment , until Charles was eventually forced through lack of money to disband the army at the end of Strafford 's trial . Disputes concerning the transfer of land ownership from native Catholic to settler Protestant , particularly in relation to the plantation of Ulster , coupled with resentment at moves to ensure the Irish Parliament was subordinate to the Parliament of England , sowed the seeds of rebellion . When armed conflict arose between the Gaelic Irish and New English , in late October 1641 , the Old English sided with the Gaelic Irish while simultaneously professing their loyalty to the king ."

    "text": "This species was described by Linnaeus in 1758 and placed in the genus Ardea that included the larger herons . Edward Blyth published a monograph on the cranes in 1881 in which he considered the \" sarus crane \" of India to be made up of two species , Grus collaris and Grus antigone . Most modern authors recognise one species with three disjunct populations that have been treated as subspecies , although the status of one extinct population from the Philippines is uncertain . The nominate subspecies from India is the largest , and in the east from Myanmar is replaced by race sharpii that extends into the Southeast Asian islands . The nominate form from the Indian subcontinent is well marked and differentiated by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck , and white tertiary remiges . Some authors consider antigone and sharpii as representatives of a formerly continuous population that varied clinally . The race in Australia , initially placed in sharpii ( sometimes spelt sharpei but amended to conform to the rules of Latin grammar ) has been separated and named as the race gilliae ( sometimes spelt gillae or even gilli ) . The Australian race was designated only in 1988 , with the species itself first noticed in Australia in 1969 and regarded as a recent immigrant . Native Australians , however , differentiated the sarus and the brolga and called the sarus \" the crane that dips its head in blood \" .

Paul de Lagarde , an Orientalist scholar , first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ( \" German Writings \" ) . Members of the Zionist movement in 1904 – 1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme , by which Russian Jews , who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms , would be settled in what today is Kenya . The plan was later rejected as unworkable by the Zionist Congress . Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state , or at least an autonomous area . The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish , Arnold Leese , and others . With the cooperation of the French , the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island . The head of the commission , Mieczysław Lepecki , felt the island could accommodate 5 @,@ 000 to 7 @,@ 000 families , but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated ."

In noncompetitive inhibition the binding of the inhibitor results in 100 % inhibition of the enzyme only , and fails to consider the possibility of anything in between .

In September 1651 , William Arnold summed up the feelings of many of the Providence settlers when he wrote , \" Whereas Mr. Coddington have gotten a charter of Road Iland and Conimacuke Iland [ Conanicut Island ] to himself , he have thereby broken the force of their charter that went under the name of Providence , because he have gotten away the greater part of that colonie . \" Clarke voiced his opposition to Coddington 's rule of the island , and on 15 October 1651 he was commissioned as the island 's agent to England . The following month he and William Dyer were sent to England to get the Coddington commission revoked . Simultaneously , the mainland towns of Providence and Warwick sent Roger Williams on a similar errand , and the three men sailed for England in November 1651 , just a few months after Clarke had been released from prison . Because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch , the men did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652 . In October 1652 , with the help of Henry Vane , Coddington 's commission for the island government was revoked . William Dyer was the messenger who returned to Rhode Island the following February , bringing the news of the return of the colony to the Williams Patent of 1643 , but Clarke remained in England with his wife ."

    "text": "The accepted view is that the main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians , and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys , were the adoption of a full deck ( katastrōma ) , the abandonment of the rams on the bow in favour of an above @-@ water spur , and the gradual introduction of lateen sails . The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram ( Latin : rostrum ; ἔμβολος , embolos ) are unclear . Depictions of upward @-@ pointing beaks in the 4th @-@ century Vatican Vergil manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys . One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient shell @-@ first mortise and tenon hull construction method , against which rams had been designed , into the skeleton @-@ first method , which produced a stronger and more flexible hull , less susceptible to ram attacks . Certainly by the early 7th century , the ram 's original function had been forgotten , if we judge by Isidore of Seville 's comments that they were used to protect against collision with underwater rocks . As for the lateen sail , various authors have in the past suggested that it was introduced into the Mediterranean by the Arabs , possibly with an ultimate origin in India . However , the discovery of new depictions and literary references in recent decades has led scholars to antedate the appearance of the lateen sail in the Levant to the late Hellenistic or early Roman period . Not only the triangular , but also the quadrilateral version were known , used for centuries ( mostly on smaller craft ) in parallel with square sails . Belisarius ' invasion fleet of 533 was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails , making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon , with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation ."

In 1963 , O 'Doherty wrote his belief that Lichtenstein 's work was not art in The New York Times saying , he was \" one of the worst artists in America \" who \" briskly went about making a sow 's ear out of a sow 's ear . \" Loran felt Pop art paled in comparison to the aesthetics of Abstract Expressionism . Lichtenstein did not accept the transformation defense . Other critics got involved in the matter , with Gene Swenson querying Lichtenstein \" about the charges of antagonistic critics ' that Pop Art does not transform its models . \" Lichtenstein responded that art forms but does not transform . Max Kozloff opined that Loran was being mocked and that while Lichtenstein 's product had didactic content , its purpose and need was questionable .

The Type 26 was produced to replace the aging Smith & Wesson New Model No. 3 and was officially adopted March 29 , 1894 . The design is widely believed to be a mixture of features taken from other revolvers . The lock design is similar to Galand designs , the hinged frame is similar to Smith & Wesson designs , and the hinged side plate covering the lock is similar to the Modèle 1892 revolver . The cartridge was loaded with black powder until 1900 when the cartridges began to be loaded with smokeless powder . The Type 26 is considered a remarkable leap in Japanese pistol development despite the international influence , with the matchlock being the most common domestic Japanese handgun 40 years earlier . Production stopped after 1923 when much of the Koishikawa Arsenal was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake , with assembly continuing until the exhaustion of stockpiled parts .

A month or two before the breeding season begins , males become larger . This is not due to extra muscle , but to altered water balance within the male 's body . This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen ; thus the more testosterone a male produces , the more he grows in advance of the breeding season . Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season , nor attempting to force females to copulate with them , it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females . Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season . This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators , or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection ."

Its most frequent prey item in the former Soviet Union is the common vole and rarely the red @-@ backed vole . In large river floodlands , water vole are common prey . In spring and winter , amphibians ( especially grass frogs and green toads ) become important food items . Selective predation on male frogs by the polecat decreases the occurrence of polyandry in frog populations . However , because amphibians have little calorific value , the polecat never grows fat on them , no matter how many it consumes . In Central Europe , the diet in winter months is dominated by birds including quail , grey partridges , grouse , chickens , pigeons and passerines . Seasonal changes in the activity rhythm is synchronised with the activity of the main prey . Some species only rarely preyed upon by the polecat include European hedgehogs , asp vipers , grass snakes and insects . In the British Isles , it commonly kills brown rats and European rabbits , and is capable of killing larger prey , such as geese and hares . One polecat was reported to frequently wait at a riverbank and catch eels , which it took back to its burrow . The polecat feeds on eels mostly during lengthy frosts when eels , unable to breathe air at regular intervals because of the ice , congregate at breathing holes . Unlike the stoat and weasel , the polecat readily eats carrion , including that of large ungulates . The European polecat hunts its prey by stalking it and seizing it with its canine teeth , killing the animal with a bite to the neck . This killing method is instinctive , but perfected with practice . The polecat sometimes caches its food , particularly during seasonal gluts of frogs and toads . Sometimes , the polecat does not kill these , but bites them at the base of the skull , thus paralyzing them and keeping them fresh for later consumption . Though they are normally shy around humans , naturalist Alfred Brehm in his Brehms Tierleben mentions an exceptional case in which three polecats attacked a baby in Hesse . During the winter period , when live prey is scarce , the European polecat may raid beehives and feed on the honey ."

    "text": "Tyler made the annexation of the Republic of Texas part of his platform soon after becoming president . Texas had declared independence from Mexico in the Texas Revolution of 1836 , although Mexico still refused to acknowledge it as a sovereign state . The people of Texas actively pursued joining the Union , but Jackson and Van Buren had been reluctant to inflame tensions over slavery by annexing another Southern state . Tyler , on the other hand , intended annexation to be the focal point of his administration . Secretary Webster was opposed ; he convinced Tyler to focus on Pacific initiatives until later in his term . Although Tyler 's desire for western expansionism is agreed upon by historians and scholars , views differ regarding the motivations behind it . Biographer Edward C. Crapol notes that during the presidency of James Monroe , Tyler ( then in the House of Representatives ) had suggested slavery was a \" dark cloud \" hovering over the Union , and that it would be \" well to disperse this cloud \" so that with fewer blacks in the older slave states , a process of gradual emancipation would begin in Virginia and other upper Southern states . Historian William W. Freehling , however , wrote that Tyler 's official motivation in annexing Texas was to outmaneuver suspected efforts by Great Britain to promote an emancipation of slaves in Texas that would weaken the institution in the United States ."

Examples of such features include gender , age , race , religion , seniority of professional qualification and area of residence . Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible differentia is Singapore citizenship .

    "text": "Since Alfred Eisenack first recognised and named the group in 1930 , the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician , Silurian and Devonian periods . Their utility is due to the rapidity of their morphological evolution , their abundance — the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram — and the easy identification ( due largely to the large variation in shapes ) and short lifetimes ( < 10 million years ) of most species . They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings , making correlation easier ; better still , they can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks . However , convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences in space and time , but sharing a similar depositional environment ; clearly , this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species . Aside from the acritarchs , chitinozoans were the only reliable means of correlating palæozoic units until the late 1960s , when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential ."

The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC , and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity .

During his visit to the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum in Manila , while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government , Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device ( IED ) . According to officials , the IED was large enough to \" blow up the entire presidential motorcade \" . Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C.

Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge . This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton 's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila . Once more , the word \" wedding \" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt . Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade , but the alternate route would add forty @-@ five minutes to the drive time . Clinton was very angry , as he was already late for the meeting , but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life .

The published works and the few others that survive , Gibbs believes , place Joseph in the category of \" progressive \" English composers .

Gibbs finds in her two short pieces , Morris Dance ( 1917 ) ( originally Barbara Noel 's Morris ) and Bergamask ( 1919 ) , three and five minutes respectively , a \" fine feeling for orchestral sound \" . The Morris Dance has added sparkle from a glockenspiel , while Bergamask has a festive Italianate feel . The music writer Philip Scowcroft praises Joseph 's confident handling of the sizeable orchestral forces required for the Morris Dance , while the composer Havergal Brian , Holst 's contemporary , found Bergamask \" exhilarating \" and \" full of promise \" . Gibbs suggests that these two works presage Holst 's late choral ballets , and comments : \" That these carefree pieces did not find a permanent place in the repertory is unfortunate \" ."

    "text": "The supergiant consistently displays irregular photometric , polarimetric and spectroscopic variations , phenomena pointing to complex activity on the star 's surface and its extended atmosphere . Martin Schwarzschild in 1975 attributed these brightness fluctuations to the changing granulation pattern formed by a few giant convection cells covering the surface of these stars . For the Sun , these convection cells , known as solar granules , represent the foremost mode of heat transfer — hence those convective elements dominate the brightness variations in the solar photosphere . The typical diameter for a solar granule is about 2000 km ( a surface area roughly the size of India ) , with an average depth of 700 km . With a surface of roughly 6 trillion km2 , there are about 2 million such granules on the Sun 's photosphere , and this large number produces a relatively constant flux . By contrast , Schwarzschild argues that stars like Betelgeuse may only have a dozen granules with diameters of 180 million kilometers or more dominating the surface of the star with depths of about 60 million kilometers , which , due to the low temperatures and extremely low density found in red supergiant envelopes , result in convective inefficiency . Consequently , if only a third of these convective cells are visible at any one time , the variations in their observable light emission may result in the recorded irregular brightness variations of the overall light from the star ."

Britain 's cavalry were trained to fight both on foot and mounted , but most other European cavalry still relied on the shock tactic of mounted charges . There were isolated instances of successful shock combat on the Western Front , where cavalry divisions also provided important mobile firepower . Beginning in 1917 , cavalry was deployed alongside tanks and aircraft , notably at the Battle of Cambrai , where cavalry was expected to exploit breakthroughs in the lines that the slower tanks could not . But , this plan never came to fruition due to missed opportunities and the use of machine guns by German forces . At Cambrai , troops from Great Britain , Canada , India and Germany participated in mounted actions . Cavalry was still deployed late in the war , with Allied cavalry troops harassing retreating German forces in 1918 during the Hundred Days Offensive , when horses and tanks continued to be used in the same battles . In comparison to their limited usefulness on the Western Front , \" cavalry was literally indispensable \" on the Eastern front and in the Middle East ."

Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new , tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural — that which cannot be rationally explained — from natural , that which can . Thus , according to Durkheim , for early humans , everything was supernatural . Similarly , he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist , such as Buddhism , where the Four Noble Truths are much more important than any individual deity . With that , Durkheim argues , we are left with the following three concepts : the sacred ( the ideas that cannot be properly explained , inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion ) , the beliefs and practices ( which create highly emotional state — collective effervescence — and invest symbols with sacred importance ) , and the moral community ( a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy ) .

    "text": "The idea of Sam & Max originated with Steve Purcell 's younger brother , Dave , who invented the concept of a comic about a detective team consisting of a dog and a rabbit in his youth . Dave would often leave the comics around the house , so Steve , in a case of sibling rivalry , often finished the incomplete stories in parodies of their original form , deliberately making the characters mix up each other 's names , over @-@ explain things , shoot at each other and mock the way in which they had been drawn , as \" kind of a parody of the way a kid talks when he 's writing comics \" . Over time , this developed from Steve merely mocking his brother 's work to him creating his own full stories with the characters . Ultimately , in the late 1970s , Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters , signing them over in a contract on Steve 's birthday and allowing him to develop the characters in his own way . In 1980 , Purcell began to produce Sam & Max comic strips for the weekly newsletter of the California College of Arts and Crafts . Whilst the visual appearance of the characters had not yet been fully developed , the stories were similar in style to those that would follow when Purcell was offered by Fish Police author Steven Moncuse the chance to publish his work properly in 1987 ."

Thus occasional long distance dispersal events , such as by deer , probably helped save this and other species with otherwise short distance dispersal ability from extinction during the glaciations of the ice ages . Furthermore , nested clade analysis of cpDNA haplotypes has shown that Trillium grandiflorum is likely to have persisted through the last glacial period in two sites of refuge in the southeastern United States and that long distance dispersal was responsible for the post @-@ glacial recolonization of northern areas ."

Harrison wrote the song shortly after the Beatles ' troubled Get Back sessions in early 1969 , during a period when his growth as a songwriter had inadvertently contributed to the dysfunction within the Beatles ' group dynamic . The lyrics reflect the toll that running their company Apple Corps had taken on relationships within the band , especially between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles , as well as Harrison 's dismay at John Lennon 's emotional withdrawal from the band .

Many metabolic pathways in the cell are inhibited by metabolites that control enzyme activity through allosteric regulation or substrate inhibition .

A key step for the regulation of glycolysis is an early reaction in the pathway catalysed by phosphofructokinase @-@ 1 ( PFK1 ) . When ATP levels rise , ATP binds an allosteric site in PFK1 to decrease the rate of the enzyme reaction ; glycolysis is inhibited and ATP production falls .

The part was originally based on the Grandmaster Melle Mel song \" White Lines ( Don 't Don 't Do It ) \" before Clayton changed to a more trance @-@ like bassline . Vocalist Bono created some melodies and sang over the music . During the album 's recording , Bono had become tired of writing in the first @-@ person and he began writing lyrics and singing from the perspective of different characters . During the writing of \" Moment of Surrender \" , Bono assumed the character of a drug addict having a crisis of faith . The song title was borrowed from the Alcoholics Anonymous term for when an addict admits being \" powerless over alcohol \" and needs help . Bono had attempted to use the phrase \" vision over visibility \" in the lyrics of earlier songs ; however , \" Moment of Surrender \" was the first song where he felt it was appropriate to be used . Eno called Bono 's singing in this character as \" so heartbreaking agonized and vulnerable \" , creating a feeling like \" a knife to the heart \" . Lanois contributed by developing the gospel @-@ like chorus . The uneven hi @-@ hat from the drum part stems from Mullen 's electronic drum kit malfunctioning during the song 's recording . Eno was amazed by each performer 's ability to develop and play their part without any instructions or cues . After the song 's recording completed , everyone in the studio , including a gathering of production personnel and visitors , was completely silent , and Eno suggested it was as if they had gone on an \" emotional adventure of some kind \" . He called the song 's recording \" the most amazing studio experience I 've ever had \" , and he believes the \" emotional crescendo \" heard in the song properly captures how they felt as they improvised the piece . Bono stated \" it was a spell and we were in it \" ."

The operation achieved some initial success , but British dominance at sea heavily influenced the campaign : the siege train was captured on its coastal barges , all supplies had to be brought overland and any French operations near the shoreline came under heavy fire from Royal Navy warships , particularly at the culminating Siege of Acre . An attempt by the French Atlantic Fleet to intervene in the Mediterranean , known as the Croisière de Bruix , failed in July 1799 . Defeated at Acre and driven back to Egypt , Bonaparte decided to return to France in November 1799 in order to take charge of the deteriorating situation in the War of the Second Coalition . He could only evacuate a small number of advisors with him on the frigates Muiron and Carrère , but promised the army remaining in Egypt under General Jean Baptiste Kléber that he would send support and reinforcements from Europe . Bonaparte successfully reached France without interception by British forces and on 9 November 1799 seized power in the coup of 18 Brumaire and proclaimed himself First Consul ."

The poem explores the stages of her life through the game , as she escapes from slavery , faces her amnesia , discovers the source of her powers , and saves the world from the insane Kefka Palazzo . Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game that Wanamo had played , and he wanted to tell the story of the game as it felt to him . Wanamo has described the arrangement as the most difficult one he had done to date . Originally , the poem was going to follow the story of the group of heroes , before Wanamo made Terra the focus , and ended up dropping the themes of the other heroes due to length . The Final Fantasy X piano concerto was arranged by Hamauzu not to tell the story of the game , but to express the \" continuum \" of the series through the lens of the game . While inspired by the game 's story , Hamauzu also drew inspiration from the rest of the franchise to make the concerto more than \" a series of separate scenes and stories \" . He feels that a hallmark of Böcker 's concerts is that they are not limited to directly translating the original works , but instead tie them to a wider creative process . Valtonen created the three movements of the Final Fantasy VII symphony to show three aspects of the game 's setting . The first movement , \" Nibelheim Incident \" , follows the villain Sephiroth in his journey through the game ; the second , \" Words Drowned by Fireworks \" , explores the relationship between Cloud Strife , Aerith Gainsborough , and Tifa Lockhart ; while the third movement , \" The Planet 's Crisis \" , depicts the final clash between Cloud and Sephiroth . He tried to \" bring out both the darkest moments as well as the heart \" of the game ."

Passenger services began from Brotton , Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875 , plus Boosbeck in 1878 . The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough . It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town , leaving that instead to the M & GR , which provided only a single @-@ platform station at the end of its line into the town . This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove . After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed , the eastbound line was joined with the M & GR line , leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur . Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus . It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964 ."

Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda , Vyakarana ( grammar ) , Jyotisha ( astronomy and astrology ) , Sahitya ( literature ) , Mimansa ( Exegesis ) , Dharmashastra ( law ) , Puranas ( ritual ) , and Nyaya ( logic ) . An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the Kavya ( classical ) style of writing was popular . The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they , though mediocre poets , had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit . An inscription in Kannada by King Krishna III , written in a poetic Kanda metre , has been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh .

These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates , followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles . Mortality increases again following sexual maturity , partly due to the stresses of reproduction . One study suggests that the rarity of juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex fossils is due in part to low juvenile mortality rates ; the animals were not dying in large numbers at these ages , and so were not often fossilized . However , this rarity may also be due to the incompleteness of the fossil record or to the bias of fossil collectors towards larger , more spectacular specimens . In a 2013 lecture , Thomas Holtz Jr. would suggest that dinosaurs \" lived fast and died young \" because they reproduced quickly whereas mammals have long life spans because they take longer to reproduce . Gregory S. Paul also writes that Tyrannosaurus reproduced quickly and died young , but attributes their short life spans to the dangerous lives they lived ."

Their reported obstacles and sightings were never corroborated by later parties . Langford and Stevenson likely did not get much further than The Enclosure . The first ascent of Grand Teton that is substantiated was made by William O. Owen , Frank Petersen , John Shive and Franklin Spencer Spalding on August 11 , 1898 .

The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve ( which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs ) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing . By destroying these nerves , this form of polio affects breathing , making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator .

The first is directional selection , which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time — for example , organisms slowly getting taller . Secondly , disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common , with selection against the average value . This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage , but not those of medium height . Finally , in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends , which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity . This would , for example , cause organisms to slowly become all the same height ."

His nearest brother was thirteen years older than he was and he was raised primarily by his conservative mother , who was distantly related to Benjamin Franklin , and his sisters . He was sent to a private academy run by a Mr. Huntington in Hadley , Massachusetts to prepare for college . Before going to college , he spent three months in Lincoln with Ezra Ripley , a distant relative who was also the stepfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson . Although Ripley wanted to attend the religiously conservative Yale University , his Unitarian father pushed him to attend Harvard College , then known as a hotbed of liberal Unitarianism . Ripley was a good and dedicated student , although he was not popular with students because of his trust of the establishment .

There , he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott , beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936 – 37 . After this , Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d 'Artus , near Huelgoat , Finistère . In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site , he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project , coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar . Meanwhile , Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec , near Quimper . In July 1939 , the project focused its attention on Normandy , with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair . They were brought to an abrupt halt in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe , and the team evacuated back to Britain .

Notwithstanding his oath to Laskaris , he aspired not only to expand his state at the expense of Thessalonica , but to eventually recover Constantinople and revive the Byzantine Empire . To secure his northern flank , Theodore allied himself with Serbia and the Albanian clans . The Principality of Arbanon was already in the Epirote political orbit under Michael I , and closer ties developed when its ruler Demetrios died in 1215 , leaving his principality to his widow , who promptly remarried the next year to a Greek magnate , Gregory Kamonas . Against the Serbs , Theodore abandoned Michael I 's attempt to pursue a northward expansion into Zeta , and instead pursued an alliance with the Serbian prince Stefan II Nemanjić ( r . 1196 – 1228 ) that was directed towards keeping the Bulgarians in check . The ties between Epirus and Serbia were solidified by the marriage of Theodore 's brother Manuel Komnenos Doukas to one of Stefan II 's sisters ca . 1216 . Stefan II then sought to wed one of his sons — in all likelihood his eldest son and heir , Stefan Radoslav — to Michael I 's second daughter Theodora . The Archbishop of Ohrid , Demetrios Chomatianos , refused to sanction the marriage due to consanguinity — Theodora was a second cousin of Stefan Radoslav 's mother , Eudokia Angelina , a daughter of Alexios III Angelos . In 1217 , Stefan II tried to circumvent this by suggesting himself as the groom to Theodora 's half @-@ sister Maria , but Chomatianos vetoed this proposal as well on similar grounds .

The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state 's arms . In 1321 , Margaret de Clare , Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle and ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella , killing six of the royal escort . Generally reserved for high @-@ ranking inmates , the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country . However it was not necessarily very secure , and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape . In 1322 Roger Mortimer , 1st Earl of March , was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub @-@ Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer 's men inside . They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat . He fled to France where he encountered Edward 's Queen . They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King . One of Mortimer 's first acts on entering England was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there . For three years he ruled while Edward III was too young to do so himself ; in 1330 , Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in the Tower . Under Edward III 's rule ( 1312 – 1377 ) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father 's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French . Amongst Edward 's successes were the battles of Crécy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner , and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville 's Cross . During this period , the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war . Edward II had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair , and by the reign of Edward III the castle was an uncomfortable place . The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons , for instance Windsor . Edward III ordered that the castle should be renovated ."

Unlike in the 1982 season , in which play was suspended for the duration of the strike , the NFL continued to play a full schedule . Games were cancelled in the third week , but returned in the fourth with rosters of replacement players . These ' scab ' players were in some cases regular players who crossed the picket line , but were usually players who had previously failed to make an NFL team . The Buccaneers ' replacement team was made up of a dozen of their training camp cuts , a dozen more players cut from other teams ' training camps , and 17 former players from the USFL 's Tampa Bay Bandits . The only regular Buccaneer to cross the picket line was center Dan Turk , although three inactive players crossed the picket line by receiving treatment for their injuries . There were a few notable names on the replacement roster . Former Bandits quarterback and Florida Gators standout John Reaves started the first two games , while former Seattle Seahawks and Winnipeg Blue Bombers quarterback Jim Zorn returned to the NFL to start for the Buccaneers in the final replacement game . Former Oklahoma and USFL standout Marcus Dupree tried out for the replacement squad , but was rejected due to health concerns . The replacement players finished with a 2 – 1 record . Several of them , notably Zorn and kicker John Carney , went on to have successful careers as players and coaches . Three replacement Buccaneers , Brian Gant , Steve Holloway , and Paul Tripoli , remained with the team once regular play resumed .

W A Povis , their engineer , was convinced that railways could be built along the routes at around half the cost of building a new line . The move was opposed by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal who argued that closing bits of the inland waterways system would have serious repercussions on the parts left . Robert Stephenson suggested that a number of railways and canals should amalgamate , to reduce competition when bills were presented to Parliament . The canals to join the Ellesmere and Chester Company were the eastern and western branches of the Montgomeryshire Canal , the Shrewsbury Canal and the Shropshire Canal . Although some would be converted to railways , the route from Ellesmere Port to Middlewich via Barbridge Junction was part of the system that would be retained as a waterway , on which salt was a major source of revenue . The plans resulted in the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1846 . The new company could raise £ 3 @.@ 3 million of new capital , in addition to that already in existence , with another £ 1 @.@ 1 million if necessary . They prompted new railways , but before any of the existing canals were converted , the company was leased to the London and North Western Railway , who took control in June 1847 . They allowed the Shropshire Union to continue to operate fairly independently , and by 1849 , the idea of conversion had been dropped , as the canals could still operate profitably ."

She was only twenty , and their marriage , a small affair at Hetzendorf ( a village just outside Vienna ) , drew considerable criticism . Antoinette 's grace and charm soon won over Viennese society . The same day British , Russian and French forces destroyed the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Navarino . Metternich worried that further intervention would topple the Ottoman Empire , upsetting the balance so carefully created in 1815 . To his relief the new British Prime Minister Wellington and his cabinet were equally fearful of giving Russia the upper hand in the Balkans . After another round of his proposals for congresses was rejected , Metternich stood back from the Eastern Question , watching as the Treaty of Adrianople was signed in September 1829 . Though he publicly criticised it for being too harsh on Turkey , privately he was satisfied with its leniency and promise of Greek autonomy , making it a buffer against Russian expansion rather than a Russian satellite state . Metternich 's private life was filled with grief . In November 1828 his mother died , and in January 1829 Antoinette died , five days after giving birth to their son , Richard von Metternich . After fighting tuberculosis for many months , Metternich 's son Viktor , then a junior diplomat , died on 30 November 1829 .

The Mount Baker Highway was added to the state highway system in 1925 as the Austin Pass branch of State Road 1 and was extended to its current terminus at Artist Point in 1931 .

The Department of Highways began clearing the highway of snow during the winter of 1934 for the film and continued annually between Glacier and Heather Meadows ; however , the highway was not cleared during World War II due to gasoline shortages . The highway was designated as the Austin Pass branch of PSH 1 during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 and renumbered to SR 542 in 1964 .

These medieval horses gained the nickname of \" Chapman Horses \" because of their use by travelling merchants known as \" chapmen \" . What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from Barb and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares . The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe , bought off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England . The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Cordoba and given to English royalty by the King of Spain . The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses , and the first infusion of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses . The Spanish horses also made their way to the outlying estates of English nobility , and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell 's men after the English Civil War . Once in the hands of Cromwell 's men , many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses , adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines . In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier or from the Moors themselves ."

Troude had shown skill and bravery in the engagement , but his subsequent reputation was largely built on the strength of a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley which was based on a letter written by Captain Troude . In the letter , he claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames , but also Caesar and Spencer ( misidentified in the report as Superb ) . Troude stated that he had not only driven all of these ships off , but that he had also completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore . Troude was subsequently promoted and highly praised , holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy . In Spain , the outcome of the campaign infuriated the Spanish government and contributed to the souring of the Franco @-@ Spanish alliance .

He was also successful in arranging with the War Office for Royal Engineers officers to study the Engineering Tripos at the university . The university drew praise for the quality of its teaching during Inglis ' tenure , though his department has been criticised for its \" comparative neglect of original research \" . From 1923 , he was involved with the analysis of vibration and its effects on railway bridges , including a period spent working with Christopher Hinton during the latter 's final year as a student at Cambridge . Inglis was appointed to a sub @-@ committee of the British government 's Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Bridge Stress Committee by Ewing , who was chairman , and became responsible for almost all of the mathematics of the investigation . Inglis derived a theory that allowed for the accurate assessment of the vibrations caused by hammer blow force imparted to the bridge by locomotives , and the committee 's 1928 report included recommendations that the hammer blow force be included in bridge design calculations in the future . During the course of this work Inglis was able to show that the increased oscillation of bridges at train speeds beyond those that corresponded with the natural frequency of the bridge was due to the influence of the locomotive 's suspension – the first time that this phenomenon had been explained . Inglis ' work on bridge vibration has been described as his most important post @-@ war research .

Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule . In the first decades after the discovery of the new lands , the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba . They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and , in 1519 , Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast . By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish . A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas . Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico , extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . The newly conquered territory became New Spain , headed by a viceroy who answered to the king of Spain via the Council of the Indies . Hernán Cortés received reports of rich , populated lands to the south and dispatched Pedro de Alvarado to investigate the region ."

Axons , because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets , grow in a particularly complex way . The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone , studded with chemical receptors . These receptors sense the local environment , causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements , and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path . The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area , where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses .

The vernacular name puffin – puffed in the sense of swollen – was originally applied to the fatty , salted meat of young birds of the unrelated species Manx shearwater ( Puffinus puffinus ) , which in 1652 was known as the \" Manks puffin \" . It is an Anglo @-@ Norman word ( Middle English pophyn or poffin ) used for the cured carcasses .

    "text": "The widespread belief in the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire , intensified after the Reformation , for women to take greater personal moral responsibility , particularly as wives and mothers . In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even to be able to independently read the Bible , but most commentators of the period , even those that tended to encourage the education of girls , thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys . Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters . In the lower ranks of society , girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation , but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately , for a shorter time and to a lower level . Girls were frequently taught reading , sewing and knitting , but not writing . Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women , such as Mary , Queen of Scots ."

Additionally , higher current requires greater flow , and generally , more helium is required to provide adequate coverage than if argon is used . Perhaps most importantly , the four primary variations of GMAW have differing shielding gas flow requirements — for the small weld pools of the short circuiting and pulsed spray modes , about 10 L / min ( 20 ft ³ / h ) is generally suitable , whereas for globular transfer , around 15 L / min ( 30 ft ³ / h ) is preferred .

The first one was a standard tracking camera system except that it was partly driven by artificial intelligence . Indeed , the system was \" aware \" of the structure of the level and therefore could anticipate certain shots . For example , in the first level , when the path to the hill is about to turn left , the camera automatically starts looking towards the left too , thus anticipating the player 's movements . The second type allows the player to control the camera relatively to Mario 's position . By pressing on the left or right buttons , the camera rotates around Mario , while pressing up or down moves the camera closer or away from Mario ."

    "text": "Ely had until 1109 been an independent monastery , but its last abbot , Richard , had proposed to the king a plan by which the abbey would become a bishopric , presumably with the abbot himself as bishop . Richard died before the proposal could be put into operation , but in 1109 , the custodian of the vacant abbey secured permission to make the change , and became the first Bishop of Ely . However , the administrative changes needed to make the abbey into a bishopric took longer , and were still unresolved at the time of Nigel 's appointment . Regardless , Nigel was constantly at court , as shown by his appearance 31 times as a witness to charters during the last 10 years of Henry I 's reign . This left little time for administration of his diocese , and Nigel appointed a married clergyman , Ranulf of Salisbury , to administer the diocese . Ranulf seems to have tyrannized the monks of the cathedral chapter , and Nigel appears to have done little to protect his monks from abuse . Later , during the early years of Stephen 's reign , Nigel claimed to have uncovered a plot led by Ranulf to assassinate Normans . The exact nature of the conspiracy is obscure , and it is unclear what prompted it . The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis claimed that Ranulf planned to kill all the Normans in the government and hand the country over to the Scots . After the discovery of the plot , Ranulf fled the country and Nigel made peace with the monks of his cathedral chapter . Another source of conflict with his monks was the desire of the cathedral chapter to enjoy the same \" liberty \" as a corporate body that the bishops did in the diocese . This liberty was a group of rights that the abbey had originally held , and had transferred to the bishop when the abbey became a bishopric . The rights included sake and soke , or the right to command dues from the land , and the right to levy tolls . They also included the right to hold courts dealing with theft . Around 1135 , Nigel conceded this point to the monks . Although he restored some of the lands that had been taken from the monks by Ranulf , the Liber Eliensis ( the house chronicle of the monks of Ely ) continued to decry his administration of the diocese and the lands of the cathedral chapter , alleging that \" he kept back for himself some properties of the church which he wanted , and very good ones they were \" . The chronicle contains a number of complaints that Nigel oppressed the monks or despoiled them ."

Corbet 's brutality was well known in the Navy , James describing him as \" an excessively severe officer \" who had a \" career of cruelty \" . James does not accuse the crew of any deliberate attempt to sabotage their ship in the engagement , instead attributing their poor gunnery to Corbet 's own failings as a commander , most significantly his failure to practice gunnery regularly . Other authors were less understanding of the crew of Africaine , Brenton stating that \" they cut the breechings of their guns , and put no shot in them after the first or second broadside \" , while historian Basil Hall baldly stated in 1833 that they \" preferred to be mown down by the French broadsides \" than fight under Corbet . This last accusation provoked outrage among naval officers , and Captain Jenkin Jones , a former shipmate of Corbet launched a successful lawsuit , forcing Hall to make a retraction . In 1900 , William Laird Clowes commented that \" There is , unfortunately , much reason to suppose that Captain Corbett 's [ sic ] reputation for extreme severity had antagonised his crew , and that the men did not behave as loyally as they should have behaved \" . He later castigates Brenton for the suggestion that Corbet committed suicide , suggesting that the wound alone was the cause of death . Modern historians have also been scathing of Corbet 's behaviour , Robert Gardiner calling him \" notoriously brutal , \" and Richard Woodman describing Tullidge as \" an unfortunate victim of Corbet 's cruelty , for suspicions lingered that Africaine 's brutalised crew had failed to do their utmost in support of their hated commander . \""

    "text": "Measurements of the redshift – magnitude relation for type Ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe has been accelerating since the universe was about half its present age . To explain this acceleration , general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large negative pressure , dubbed \" dark energy \" . Dark energy , though speculative , solves numerous problems . Measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat , and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the critical density of mass / energy . But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering , and is found to have only about 30 % of the critical density . Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the \" missing \" energy density . Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe , one using the frequency of gravitational lenses , and the other using the characteristic pattern of the large @-@ scale structure as a cosmic ruler ."

Van Gogh applied the word \" purposeful \" to paintings he thought he had mastered , as opposed to those he thought of as studies .

The finished paintings – such as Night Cafe and Starry Night , are the works he considered part of his oeuvre . The work in Arles contributed considerably to his oeuvre : those he thought the most important from that time were The Sower , Night Cafe , Memory of the Garden in Etten and Starry Night .

Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper created the series in response to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles craze of the early 1990s . To create a contrast to the popular media franchise and other \" beat ' em ups \" of the time , Rare added extra mechanics in the game to help separate it from these genres , such as racing stages and climbing courses . According to Rare artist Kev Bayliss , the characters of Battletoads were conceived in order to \" produce merchandise \" on a mass scale , in similar vein Tim Burton 's Batman reboot . The game underwent changes through early stages of development , and at one point was originally titled Amphibianz .

    "text": "The first fossils of Massospondylus were described by paleontologist Sir Richard Owen in 1854 . Originally , Owen did not recognize these finds as those of a dinosaur ; instead he attributed them to \" large , extinct , carnivorous reptiles \" that were related to today 's lizards , chameleons and iguanas . This material , a collection of 56 bones , was found in 1853 by the government surveyor Joseph Millard Orpen in the Upper Elliot Formation at Harrismith , South Africa and was donated to the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London . Among the remains were vertebrae from the neck , back , and tail ; a shoulder blade ; a humerus ; a partial pelvis ; a femur ; a tibia ; and bones of the hands and feet . All these bones were found disarticulated , making it difficult to determine if all material belongs to a single species or not . However , Owen was able to distinguish three different types of caudal vertebrae , which he attributed to three different genera : Pachyspondylus , Leptospondylus and Massospondylus . Massospondylus was separated from the other two genera on the basis of its much longer caudal vertebrae , which also lead to the scientific name that has been derived from the Greek terms masson / μάσσων ' longer ' and sphondylos / σφόνδυλος ' vertebra ' . However , later it was shown that the putative caudal vertebrae of Massospondylus were actually cervical vertebrae and that all the material probably belongs only to a single species . On May 10 , 1941 , the Hunterian Museum was demolished by a German bomb , destroying all the fossils ; only casts remain ."

A couple of factors stemming from early experiments have played a role in the development of this assumption . First , the experimental design of older tests may have favored the natural behavior and ecology of simians over that of strepsirrhines , making the experimental tasks inappropriate for lemurs . For example , simians are known for their manipulative play with non @-@ food objects , whereas lemurs are only known to manipulate non @-@ food objects in captivity . This behaviour is usually connected with food association . Also , lemurs are known to displace objects with their nose or mouth more so than with their hands .

Second , individual ring @-@ tailed lemurs accustomed to living in a troop may not respond well to isolation for laboratory testing .

    "text": "Tropical cyclones typically form from large , disorganized areas of disturbed weather in tropical regions . As more thunderstorms form and gather , the storm develops rainbands which start rotating around a common center . As the storm gains strength , a ring of stronger convection forms at a certain distance from the rotational center of the developing storm . Since stronger thunderstorms and heavier rain mark areas of stronger updrafts , the barometric pressure at the surface begins to drop , and air begins to build up in the upper levels of the cyclone . This results in the formation of an upper level anticyclone , or an area of high atmospheric pressure above the central dense overcast . Consequently , most of this built up air flows outward anticyclonically above the tropical cyclone . Outside the forming eye , the anticyclone at the upper levels of the atmosphere enhances the flow towards the center of the cyclone , pushing air towards the eyewall and causing a positive feedback loop ."

Although he urged Michael to confront Leo the Armenian , following Michael 's deposition by Leo ( r . 813 – 820 ) , Manuel was promoted to the rank of patrikios and entrusted with the post of strategos of the Armeniac or the Anatolic Theme . The latter post was the most senior of the Byzantine Empire 's thematic governors , and Leo himself had held the office prior to his accession . According to historians John B.

One torpedo sank Conte di Cavour in shallow water , but Giulio Cesare was not hit during the attack . She participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November 1940 , but never got close enough to any British ships to fire at them . The ship was damaged in January 1941 by splinters from a near miss during an air raid on Naples by Vickers Wellington bombers of the Royal Air Force ; repairs at Genoa were completed in early February . On 8 February , she sailed from to the Straits of Bonifacio to intercept what the Italians thought was a Malta convoy , but was actually a raid on Genoa . She failed to make contact with any British forces . She participated in the First Battle of Sirte on 17 December 1941 , providing distant cover for a convoy bound for Libya , again never firing her main armament . She also provided distant cover for another convoy to North Africa in early January 1942 . Giulio Cesare was reduced to a training ship afterwards at Taranto and later Pola . The German submarine U @-@ 596 unsuccessfully attacked the ship in the Gulf of Taranto in early March 1944 . After the Italian surrender on 9 September 1943 , she steamed to Taranto , putting down a mutiny and enduring an ineffective attack by five German aircraft en route .

They knew how to manufacture charms , cast spells , and practice geomancy using local gemstones . To maintain their distinction from other members of Antemoro society , the Anakara lived in villages sealed off by spiked wooden palisades where none could enter without permission . Rulers were further distinguished by fady forbidding them to wear shirts or hats ."

An active member of the group , he married Anna Ancher 's cousin Martha Møller in 1880 . From 1885 , he exhibited in Paris where he was inspired by Claude Monet . His paintings took on lighter tones as he had noted the absence of black in the works of the French artists and considered his own earlier works too dark by comparison . Monet 's use of colour is reflected in his painting Christian Bindslev is ill ( 1890 ) . The work displays stronger contrasts than his earlier paintings , depicting the red @-@ bearded Christian looking out towards the light at the foot of his bed where the flaming gold and white sunlight streams down onto the little blue cupboard on the wall .

He was defended by Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena , who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus , ordering him to attack the client state . Later , Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus . Such orders , had they been given , would have been considered a breach of the Senate 's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath — i.e. , before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius — as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate 's jurisdiction , not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus . Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus , and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen , a first among equals .

The architect was Frank Flemming , who designed 85 churches throughout South Africa . The church was constructed in 1933 . The bell tower was added in 1936 . So little money was made available for the construction that the architect called it a \" Holy Barn \" . The church 's distinctive feature was a mural that is no longer visible . It was painted between 1939 and 1941 by Sister Margaret . The church was an icon of the liberation struggle in South Africa . In 1940 Trevor Huddleston was appointed Rector . He was an outspoken opponent of apartheid . In 1955 during the forced removals , Huddleston was recalled to England . His ashes reside next to his former church . On the north @-@ eastern side of the church there is a mural depicting Huddleston walking the dusty streets of Sophiatown . This mural was painted by 12 apprentice students under patronage of the Gerard Sekoto Foundation . It shows two children tugging at his cassock as well as Sekoto 's famous yellow houses . The entire Sophiatown community was removed by the end of 1963 ; the church was deconsecrated in 1964 and sold to the Department of Community Development in 1967 . In the 1970s it was bought by the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk , which used it for Sunday School . The church changed hands again and the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk bought the building and altered it significantly . The nave was enclosed , a large font was built and wooden panelling and false organ pipes changed the look of the interior . In 1997 the Anglicans bought the church back and it was reconsecrated ; the changes were reversed and the building was largely restored to its former self . However , the hall and gallery the Pinkster Protestantse Kerk had built were retained ."

The Allies had previously used creeping barrages at the battles of Neuve Chapelle and the Somme but had encountered two technical problems . The first was accurately synchronising the movement of the troops to the fall of the barrage : for Arras , this was overcome by rehearsal and strict scheduling . The second was the barrage falling erratically as the barrels of heavy guns wore swiftly but at differing rates during fire : for Arras , the rate of wear of each gun barrel was calculated and calibrated accordingly . While there was a risk of friendly fire , the creeping barrage forced the Germans to remain in their shelters , allowing Allied soldiers to advance without fear of machine gun fire .

The headquarters was especially concerned about Stojanović 's treatment of captured Home Guards : he would give them a communist propaganda speech , offer them food and cigarettes , dress their wounds , and let them go home . According to the headquarters , this treatment rendered these particular Home Guards useless in future operations against the Partisans . According to Drago Karasijević , the courage and fighting spirit of the Kozara Partisans became famous in Bosanska Krajina , in other parts of Bosnia and in the areas of the NDH bordering on Bosnia .

When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor . Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment , according to Lee . A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted . Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament , because it acted without constituted legal authority . Finally the daughter , Mary as Myrrha , is described as an impious outcast from civilization , whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion . When Myrrha craves and achieves her father 's ( Cinyras ' ) bed , Lee sees a parallel to Mary 's ascending James ' throne : both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers ."

    "text": "It was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed . Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium , by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light . Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion , the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887 . The detected motion was always less than the observational error . Modern experiments indicate that the two @-@ way speed of light is isotropic ( the same in every direction ) to within 6 nanometres per second . Because of this experiment Hendrik Lorentz proposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus to contract along its length in the direction of motion , and he further assumed , that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly ( \" local time \" ) , which led to the formulation of the Lorentz transformation . Based on Lorentz 's aether theory , Henri Poincaré ( 1900 ) showed that this local time ( to first order in v / c ) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether , which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed . In 1904 , he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics , provided that the assumptions of Lorentz 's theory are all confirmed . In 1905 , Poincaré brought Lorentz 's aether theory into full observational agreement with the principle of relativity ."

The reason , they say , is that it did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies , including the twistgrip throttle control , and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle as we know it today , while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude , failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork , and turn by leaning . Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees , rather than perfectly vertical , and by having the steering axis slightly offset , creating trail . This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive , and typically unconscious , technique of countersteering , in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left , causing the machine to lean to the right , and turning the vehicle to the right . Trail , also called fork offset , is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics , and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down , so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle .

The most widely travelled migrant is the Wilson 's storm petrel which after breeding in Antarctica and the subantarctic islands regularly crosses the equator to the waters of the north Pacific and Atlantic . Other species undertake migrations of differing lengths ; long ones , such as the Swinhoe 's storm petrel , which breeds in the west Pacific and migrates to the west Indian Ocean ; or shorter ones , such as the black storm petrel which nests in southern California and migrates down the coast of Central America as far south as Colombia .

After Iris reached winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) early on October 7 , its intensity remained steady for about 24 hours . During that time , the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted , possibly due to an upper @-@ level low .

Students are streamed into classes by virtue of their subject combination .

Administratively , the student population are sometimes grouped by the stream and the first number : S6 or S7 . A1 is however not used often to categorize the student population because all the arts stream classes have 1 as the first number of the class number .

French Percherons were also hit hard by the advent of mechanization , and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the meat market .

In 1993 , a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the black stallion Silver Shadows Sheik . This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant , smaller and sleeker look in the French Percheron , while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure .

    "text": "The first documented reference to industry in Radcliffe is after 1680 , in the Radcliffe parish registers , which make increasing mention of occupations such as woollen webster ( weaving ) , linen webster , and whitster ( bleacher ) . These were cottage industries which worked alongside local agriculture . In 1780 Robert Peel built the first factory in the town , several hundred yards upstream from Radcliffe Bridge ( at the end of Peel Street ) . With a weir and goit providing motive power for a water wheel , the factory was built for throstle spinning and the weaving of cotton — a relatively new introduction to Britain . The water wheel proved to be insufficient , and so around 1804 the goit was extended . The weir ( known as Rectory Weir ) was made from timber . Conditions were poor ; the mill employed child labour bought from workhouses in Birmingham and London . Children were boarded on an upper floor of the building , and bound until they reached the age of 21 . They were unpaid , and were kept locked up each night . Shifts were typically 10 – 10 @.@ 5 hours in length , and children returning from a day shift would sleep in the same bed as children leaving for a night shift . Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were \" very bad \" . In 1784 an outbreak of typhoid prompted Lord Grey de Wilton to inform the magistrates of the Salford Hundred ; keen to prevent the spread of the disease to neighbouring towns and villages , they sent doctors to assess the situation . Their recommendations included leaving the windows of the mill open at night , fumigation of rooms with tobacco ( as this was thought to discourage disease ) , regular cleaning of rooms and toilets and occasional bathing of children . The report forced the magistrates , led by Thomas Butterworth Bayley , to abandon the practice of binding parish apprentices to any mill not adhering to these conditions . The report also prompted Peel to introduce an Act of Parliament to improve factory hygiene , which later became the Factory Act of 1802 . Over time , conditions at the mill improved ; in the mid @-@ 1790s the physician John Aikin , a critic of the factory system , praised working conditions at the mill , and in 1823 inspections by local magistrates of conditions in mills across the county revealed that unlike many others , the factory at Radcliffe was adhering to all requirements of the Factory Acts ."

The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses . Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence , but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood . Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking , where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star 's magnetic field .

Nos. 76 and 82 Squadrons disbanded in October , the former subsequently re @-@ emerging and joining No. 78 Wing when it deployed to Malta in 1952 . No. 81 Wing headquarters and No. 481 Squadron were disbanded in November 1948 , followed by No. 111 MFCU in January 1949 . Detachments of No. 381 Squadron and No. 5 ACS remained with No. 77 Squadron under the aegis of a new organisation called RAAF Component , eventually disbanding in February and April 1950 , respectively . No. 77 Squadron personnel were preparing to return to Australia when , on 25 June 1950 , they were placed on standby for action in the Korean War , which had just broken out ; the unit began flying missions over Korea a week later ."

One contributing factor is pollen limitation , and one study showed that open pollinated plants had 56 % of their ovules produce seeds , while in hand pollinated individuals the figure was 66 % . Plants with reduced exposure to pollinators were 33 % to 50 % less likely to produce fruits than those that were , while hand pollinated individuals showed a 100 % fruit set ( though these fruits did not contain a 100 % seed set ) . Plant resources were shown to be a limiting factor in seed production : when pollen was in abundance , larger plants had a significantly greater seed to ovule ratio than smaller ones . The overall suboptimal seed to ovule ratios suggest that Trillium grandiflorum has evolved to maximize reproductive success in the face of highly stochastic pollination , where some plants may only be visited by a single pollinator in a season ."

The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it . Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm , connective tissues are derived from mesoderm , and gut is derived from the endoderm . At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut . The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal , and the anus at the base of the tail . The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column , formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae . In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs . However , a few vertebrates , such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood . Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages , fins or legs , which may be secondarily lost . The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor .

It took the standards of The New Yorker editors , among them William Shawn , to refine his writing into the \" spare , teasingly mysterious , withheld \" qualities of \" A Perfect Day for Bananafish \" ( 1948 ) , The Catcher in the Rye , and his stories of the early 1950s . By the late 1950s , as Salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study , Hamilton notes that his stories became longer , less plot @-@ driven , and increasingly filled with digression and parenthetical remarks . Louis Menand agrees , writing in The New Yorker that Salinger \" stopped writing stories , in the conventional sense ... He seemed to lose interest in fiction as an art form — perhaps he thought there was something manipulative or inauthentic about literary device and authorial control . \" In recent years , some critics have defended certain post @-@ Nine Stories works by Salinger ; in 2001 , Janet Malcolm wrote in The New York Review of Books that \" Zooey \" \" is arguably Salinger 's masterpiece ... Rereading it and its companion piece \" Franny \" is no less rewarding than rereading The Great Gatsby . \""
