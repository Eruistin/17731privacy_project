It is a well @-@ known natural hybrid of what many consider to be the two most spectacular Nepenthes species of Borneo : N. rajah and N. villosa . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis is only found on Mount Kinabalu ( hence the name ) and nearby Mount Tambuyukon , where the two parent species are occur sympatrically . More specifically , plants are known from a footpath near Paka Cave and several places along an unestablished route on a south @-@ east ridge , which lies on the west side of the Upper Kolopis River . The only accessible location from which this hybrid is known is the Kinabalu summit trail , between Layang @-@ Layang and the helipad , where it grows at about 2900 m in a clearing dominated by Dacrydium gibbsiae and Leptospermum recurvum trees . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an altitudinal distribution of 2420 to 3030 m . It grows in open areas in cloud forest . This hybrid can be distinguished from N. rajah by the presence of raised ribs that line the inner edge of the peristome and end with elongated teeth . These are more prominent than those found in N. rajah and are clue as to the hybrid 's parentage ( N. villosa has highly developed peristome ribs ) . The peristome is coarse and expanded at the margin ( but not scalloped like that of N. rajah ) , the lid orbiculate or reniformed and almost flat . In general , pitchers are larger than those of N. villosa and the tendril joins the apex about 1 – 2 cm below the leaf tip , a feature which is characteristic of N. rajah . In older plants , the tendril can be almost woody . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis has an indumentum of villous hairs covering the pitchers and leaf margins , which is approximately intermediate between the parents . Lower pitchers have two fringed wings , whereas the upper pitchers usually lack these . The colour of the pitcher varies from yellow to scarlet . Nepenthes × kinabaluensis seems to produce upper pitchers more readily than either of its parents . In all respects N. × kinabaluensis is intermediate between the two parent species and it is easy to distinguish from all other Nepenthes of Borneo . However , it has been confused once before , when the hybrid was labelled as N. rajah in Letts Guide to Carnivorous Plants of the World ( Cheers , 1992 ) ."

In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double @-@ strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages ( interstrand crosslinks or ICLs ) .

However , audiences loved the scenes and machines and operas , as Samuel Pepys ' diary shows . Dryden wrote several baroque machine plays himself . The first , The State of Innocence ( 1677 ) , was never staged , as his designated company , the King 's , had neither the capital nor the machinery for it : a dramatisation of John Milton 's Paradise Lost , it called for \" rebellious angels wheeling in the air , and seeming transfixed with thunderbolts \" over \" a lake of brimstone or rolling fire \" . The King 's Company 's Theatre Royal , Drury Lane was not up to lakes of rolling fire ; only the \" machine house \" at Dorset Garden was , and that belonged to the competition , the Duke 's Company .

    "text": "In 2010 , IP Australia ruled on the trademark opposition dispute between Deckers and Luda Production Pty Ltd , granting Luda the right to register the trademarks UGG AUSTRALIA ( & Design ) and MADE BY UGG AUSTRALIA with costs awarded against Deckers . Luda declared that the \" element ugg \" was used generically in the sheepskin boot market but that its use had not caused any confusion with Luda 's UGG AUSTRALIA products . Luda began manufacturing ugg boots in 1981 and in 1982 began selling its boots with woven heel counters featuring the UGG AUSTRALIA mark . In 1984 , the company was incorporated at which time Luda had attempted to trademark its UGG AUSTRALIA logo but was asked by the Trade Mark Office not to proceed as the name was \" descriptive \" and was therefore not registerable . In 2004 , Luda filed another trademark application after becoming aware of \" other products being sold bearing variations of the element UGG \" in conjunction with the word \" Australia . \" Deckers opposed the application on three grounds , prior use ( Deckers argued that the prior use shown by Luda was invalid as the mark they sought to register was not \" an exact copy \" of the mark they used ) , that Deckers had a more significant reputation in Australia and that Luda had filed the application in bad faith . The court found that Deckers did not have a significant reputation in an Australian market which was dominated by Luda Productions , and thus failed the requirements of the Trade Practices Act , regarding public misapprehension of the origin of the manufacturer . The court noted that Luda 's use of the term \" UGG AUSTRALIA \" predated Deckers ' infringement defense by 22 years , which negated Deckers ' claim that Luda was trading upon their reputation and that Luda had not filed in bad faith , but in order to gain statutory protection for trade marks already recognized in Australia . Regarding a non @-@ use action between Deckers and Luda Production Pty , IP Australia confirmed that Deckers owned the trademark of their UGG AUSTRALIA label ( with sun @-@ like device ) , however the scope of Deckers ' trademark was narrowed , restricted to just footwear ."

Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness , so that Mountstuart ’ s journal alludes almost casually to the war , the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king . Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity , introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters – a spat with Virginia Woolf in London , a possible sexual encounter with Evelyn Waugh at Oxford , a clumsy exchange with James Joyce in Paris , and a friendship with Ernest Hemingway that spans several years ."

    "text": "During the MCC tour to Australia in 1928 – 29 , the Australian batsman Donald Bradman made his Test debut . Covering the tour as a journalist , Fender judged that Bradman \" was one of the most curious mixtures of good and bad batting I have ever seen \" , but was not convinced by his ability at the time . Bradman came to England with the Australian touring team in 1930 , and was extremely successful ; during the course of the season , Fender completely changed his mind — not least when Bradman , particularly determined to succeed against Fender following his criticism , scored 252 against Surrey . Fender played fewer matches than in previous seasons , as he was writing on the Tests for a newspaper ; in the 1930 season , he scored 700 runs and took 65 wickets . Meanwhile , the Australian victory in the Test series owed much to Bradman , who scored 974 runs in seven innings , breaking several records in the process . His success , and the manner of it , concerned the English authorities , and Fender among others believed that success against Bradman was to be found in adopting new tactics . In his newspaper reports that summer , Fender was critical of Bradman 's batting during one spell in the final Test when he batted unconvincingly against fast bowler Harold Larwood on a pitch affected by rain . Fender passed this information on to his Surrey colleague Douglas Jardine , who was later named England captain for the MCC tour of 1932 – 33 . Over the following months , Australian journalists kept Fender informed of developments in batting in that country , information which he passed on to Jardine . Jardine later conceived the strategy of Bodyline , where fast bowlers bowled at the batsmen 's leg stump , frequently pitching the ball short and hitting him . The tactic was contentious , and created much ill @-@ feeling between the players . Fender did not cover the tour as a journalist , as his newspaper sent Jack Hobbs instead . However , during the tour Jardine wrote to inform Fender that much of his information had been correct and that he was adapting his tactics accordingly . Fender later insisted that his role was minor in creating the strategy , but he was close to both Jardine and Arthur Carr , who discussed the plans before the tour began ; some writers suggested that the original idea was Fender 's ."

Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February , and the larvae collected were not large enough to be reproductive ants . However , it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer , and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli , alates most likely start to occur by June . After nuptial flight , queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants . This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction . The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs on the side of the larvae . This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group . Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages . Unlike the larvae and pupae , the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries , but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest . In large nests , small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent ."

He thought it \" seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems \" , and therefore believed an episode based on it would be a good idea . According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner , the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas . A writer for Newsday has commented that episode skewers \" the annual craze for that one ' hot ' toy . \" This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully , who said in 2008 that \" Grift of the Magi \" was produced around the time when \" every year there seemed to be a hot toy .

    "text": "Because the first forty official copies are made of the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions , periodic verifications using a large number of replicas — especially the national primary standards , which are rarely used — can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK . What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other . It is also clear that the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50 µg over the last century , and possibly significantly more , in comparison to its official copies . The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass . No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK , or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world . This relative nature of the changes amongst the world 's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press , and even some notable scientific magazines , which often state that the IPK simply \" lost 50 µg \" and omit the very important caveat of \" in comparison to its official copies \" . Moreover , there are no technical means available to determine whether or not the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long @-@ term trends upwards or downwards because their mass \" relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000 µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years \" .

The arrival of these types of chemical plants to inhabited parts of the city provoked public criticism of the new technology . This was also directed at poisonous effluent generated by the plant operations . These harsh critiques were especially fierce once accidental explosions occurred at some plants . Accum , who by this point was a leading proponent of gaslight in addition to his work as a chemist , strongly refuted these criticisms in his writings . Through careful analysis he showed that as a whole , accidents were caused by carelessness of plant workerman rather than problems with the technology , and were therefore avoidable ."

Williams stated that the farm of Duncansby , located near the Dales of Caithness , was then in hands of an Orkney chieftain , Óláfr Hrólfsson . Joshua Prescott stated that Óláfr appears to have been Earl Páll 's main supporter in Caithness ; according to Williams , Óláfr appears to have held these lands directly from the Earls of Orkney , rather than as a family possession . The saga relates of how at Duncansby , Ölvir and his party surprised Óláfr within his own house . They then set fire to the house , and burn Óláfr to death within . Ölvir and his men took all the movable property they could get their hands on , before leaving the scene . When Earl Páll heard of what has happened , he takes @-@ in the slain chieftain 's son , Sveinn Óláfsson . With the death of his father , Sveinn Óláfsson becomes known as Sveinn Ásleifarson — after his mother . Such house @-@ burnings — in which individuals are burnt to death , or slain as they flee the fire — are found throughout the sagas as a part of blood feuds . The saga states that some time later , Sveinn , who has spent time in the Suðreyjar and Atholl , returned to Orkney . On his way , Sveinn he stopped at Thurso , where his accomplice , Ljótólfr , negotiated a truce between Sveinn and Frakökk 's brother , Earl Óttarr . The earl paid Sveinn compensation for the death of Óláfr , and promised his friendship . In return , Sveinn promised to aid Earl Óttarr 's relative , Erlendr Haraldsson , in a possible bid for the earldom of Orkney ."

She appeared bald but wore a teal colored fringed dress , and sang an acoustic version of \" Hair \" , while staring at a teal colored wig placed in front of her . The piano on which she sang was covered with brown , curly hair and she was surrounded by flames . Halfway through the performance , Gaga took the wig and placed it on her head .

In the event that the debtor uses the money for any other purpose , it is held on trust for the creditor . Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced , and returned to the creditors . The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd ( 1970 ) , although the underlying principles can be traced back further . There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law : whether they are resulting trusts , express trusts , constructive trusts or , as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley , illusory trusts ."

    "text": "Analysis of the construction of tower houses has focused on two key driving forces . The first is that the construction of these castles appears to have been linked to periods of instability and insecurity in the areas concerned . In Scotland James IV 's forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across the region and , over the longer term , an increased degree of clan warfare , while the subsequent wars with England in the 1540s added to the level of insecurity over the rest of the century . Irish tower houses were built from the end of the 14th century onward as the countryside disintegrated into the unstable control of a large number of small lordships and Henry VI promoted their construction with financial rewards in a bid to improve security . English tower houses were built along the frontier with Scotland in a dangerous and insecure period . Secondly , and paradoxically , appears to have been the periods of relative prosperity . Contemporary historian William Camden observed of the northern English and the Scots , \" there is not a man amongst them of a better sort that hath not his little tower or pile \" , and many tower houses seem to have been built as much as status symbols as defensive structures . Along the English @-@ Scottish borders the construction pattern follows the relative prosperity of the different side : the English lords built tower houses primarily in the early 15th century , when northern England was particularly prosperous , while their Scottish equivalents built them in late 15th and early 16th centuries , boom periods in the economy of Scotland . In Ireland the growth of tower houses during the 15th century mirrors the rise of cattle herding and the resulting wealth that this brought to many of the lesser lords in Ireland ."

    "text": "Because rodents are a nuisance and endanger public health , human societies often attempt to control them . Traditionally , this involved poisoning and trapping , methods that were not always safe or effective . More recently , integrated pest management attempts to improve control with a combination of surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population , the establishment of tolerance limits ( levels of pest activity at which to intervene ) , interventions , and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys . Interventions may include education , making and applying laws and regulations , modifying the habitat , changing farming practices , and biological control using pathogens or predators , as well as poisoning and trapping . The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals , and rodents often become resistant . The use of predators including ferrets , mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory . Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively , provided the rodent population is not too large . In the UK , two species in particular , the house mouse and the brown rat , are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops , loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities , as well as to comply with the law ."

William Makepeace Thackeray was a visitor to the court during Sir Charles 's time and it was the inspiration for the house Castlewood which featured in his novel The History of Henry Esmond although , contrary to common belief , it is improbable that he wrote any of it at Clevedon Court . Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Clevedon briefly during this period and may have visited the Court ."

In his 2013 A Theory of Justice for Animals , Garner challenges Cochrane on his use of the argument from marginal cases . If animals are assumed to have an equal interest in life as typical humans because marginal humans are , then one could also assume animals to have an equal interest in liberty , because of the assumption of marginal humans ' interest in liberty . Cochrane , however , denies that marginal humans are assumed to have a strong interest in liberty . The first part of the argument , Garner observes , assumes that marginal humans are considered to have an equal interest in ( or an equal right to ) life ; this is a claim which Garner challenges , reaching what he considers a more nuanced position than Cochrane 's . Nonetheless , the ideal theory which Garner endorses — the enhanced sentience position — is close to Cochrane 's interest @-@ based rights position . Garner himself identifies differences between his thought and Cochrane 's in their respective use of the argument from marginal cases and the fact that Garner offers a nonideal theory , while Cochrane does not .

This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo @-@ American landings in French North Africa , which resulted in the region joining the Allies .

Evidence of foot binding as a new trend in the Southern Song period certainly reinforces this notion .

Men dominated the public sphere , while affluent wives spent most of their time indoors enjoying leisure activities and managing the household .

The record , which fused techno and flamenco , was met with critical and commercial indifference , and today Sanz views the record to be \" insignificant \" . However , the album is now considered to be a collector 's item . In an attempt to promote Los Chulos Son Pa ' Cuidarlos , he performed at strip clubs , playing short sets between acts . This proved to be unsuccessful and Sanz took a break from music , choosing to study business administration . He also took a job at a recording studio in which he wrote material for other artists . He persuaded Arenas to send demos of his songs to record companies , which led to being signed by Warner Music Latina . At this time , he began performing under his current name ."

However , these had not been exploited : while the Wehrmacht at the time still had many shortcomings in equipment and training , the Dutch army in comparison was like David compared to Goliath . The myth of the general German equipment advantage over the opposing armies in the Battle of France was in fact a reality in the case of the Battle of the Netherlands . On the one hand there was the modern German army with tanks and dive bombers ( such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka ) and on the other hand the Dutch army , whose armoured forces comprised only 39 armoured cars and five tankettes , and an air force for a large part consisting of biplanes . The Dutch government 's attitude towards war was reflected in the state of the country 's armed forces , which had not significantly expanded their equipment since before the First World War , and were inadequately armed even by the standards of 1918 . During the 1920s , an economic recession lasting from 1920 until 1927 and the general détente in international relations caused a limitation of the defence budget . In that decade , only 1 @.@ 5 million guilders per annum was spent on equipment .

IGN warned that gamers with lesser skills might not \" get as much out of this game as others due to [ its ] incredible difficulty \" , and Edge commented that \" Tecmo ’ s refusal to extend any kind of handhold to less dedicated players is simply a failure of design , not a badge of hardcore honour \" and \" it ’ s impossible to believe they couldn ’ t have found a way to increase the accessibility of the game without undermining the gloriously intractable nature of the challenges it contains . \" EGM found the challenge to be \" rewarding \" as it \" motivates you to actually get better at the game . \" Clive Thompson focused on Ninja Gaiden in his Slate article examining the motivation for playing difficult games . He contends that extreme levels of challenge can be initially very frustrating and may cause a game to be abandoned in disgust . However , where a game also rewards a player 's perseverance by teaching the skills required to overcome its challenges , that player will have the motivation to finish the game .

To date , Minton remains the last member of Congress , sitting or former , to be appointed to the United States Supreme Court , and he is the only native of Indiana to be appointed to the court ."

Chettiar opposed casting Rajinikanth as the protagonist because of his dark skin and typecasting as a villain at the time , but Mahendran refused to direct the film without the actor and Chettiar capitulated . Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience , cinematographer Balu Mahendra ( a director himself ) assisted Mahendran with the screenplay , dialogue , camera angles , casting and editing . The film significantly deviates from the novel , with Mahendran having read only a part of it . Filming lasted for roughly 30 days , and primarily took place in Sringeri , Ooty , Glenmorgan and Kundha . Chettiar was surprised that the finished film had less dialogue than visuals , which he did not expect from Mahendran ."

Also , it is not entirely clear what the word \" countertenor \" means in this context . The record is ambivalent as to whether Purcell ( himself a countertenor ) used a tenor with a particularly high range ( though lighter at the top ) and tessitura ( known sometimes as a haute @-@ contre , the descendants of the contratenors alti of medieval polyphony ) or a falsettist . It seems that throughout his career he used both . However , purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude , it is more likely than not that the travesty role of Mopsa was taken by a falsettist , and the presence of a duet for two male altos ( \" Let the fifes and the clarions \" ) makes it seem more probable that for this work falsettists were employed ."

Next , they traded defenseman Kris Russell to the St. Louis Blues for Nikita Nikitin . As the clubs slow start continued , there were rumors that Head Coach Scott Arniel would be fired and replaced with Ken Hitchcock . Hitchcock had previously coached the Blue Jackets to their only playoff appearance in club history and was still under contract with the franchise through to the end of the season . Before any of these rumors came to fruition , the St. Louis Blues asked Columbus for permission to hire Hitchcock , which the Blue Jackets allowed . Hitchcock began his Blues coaching career with a 6 – 1 – 2 record in his first nine games , while Columbus amassed a 6 – 13 – 3 record to start the season ."

USGamer 's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence , intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat . He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified , making the story more powerful . Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that , despite the \" incredibly brutal \" combat , the violence never felt gratuitous . Eurogamer 's Welsh echoed similar remarks , stating that the violence is not \" desensitized or mindless \" . Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game 's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices . Joystiq 's Mitchell wrote that the violence is \" designed to be uncomfortable \" , stating that it contributes to Joel 's character . Prior to the release of the game , Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game ."

The success of the Estonian operation would have provided an unobstructed lane to advance along the coast to Tallinn , forcing the German Army Group North to escape from Estonia for fear of getting cornered . For the Baltic Fleet trapped in an eastern bay of the Gulf of Finland , Tallinn was the closest exit to the Baltic Sea . The ejection of the Army Group North from Estonia would have made Finland subject to air and amphibious attacks originating from Estonian bases . The prospect of an invasion of East Prussia through Estonia appealed even more to Stavka , as it could bring German resistance to a standstill .

In particular the theme of racial degeneration is a prominent aspect in the novel . Moving into the fin de siècle , late @-@ Victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay . In She , this evolutionary concept of degeneration is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger . Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities , \" a curious mingling of races \" , originally descended from the inhabitants of Kôr but having intermarried with Arabs and Africans . Racial hybridisation of any kind \" entailed degeneration \" to Victorians , a \" decline from the pure blood \" of the initial races , and thus \" an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their Kôr ancestors may have imparted to them \" . Thus , Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired : \" for Arabian am I by birth , even ' al Arab al Ariba ' ( an Arab of the Arabs ) , and of the race of our father Yárab , the son of Khâtan [ ... ] of the true Arab blood \" . However , the novel 's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha .

Explaining the decision to develop a prequel , Holmes said while the Batman of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City was comparable to his comic counterpart — a fully formed , experienced character — Arkham Origins could explore other aspects of the character ( such as his lack of experience and greater vulnerability ) . The game was considered 80 percent complete by January 2013 , and WB Montréal used the remaining development time to tweak the final product ."

Kepler supposed that the motive power ( or motive species ) radiated by the Sun weakens with distance , causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it . Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order . Based on measurements of the aphelion and perihelion of the Earth and Mars , he created a formula in which a planet 's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun . Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle , however , required very extensive calculation ; to simplify this task , by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry : planets sweep out equal areas in equal times — Kepler 's second law of planetary motion ."

According to Dance magazine , jookin is characterized by dancers \" gliding footwork ... popping and waving ...

While watching a jookin ' battle in Jackson , Tennessee , dance critic Alastair Macaulay observed that \" the most evidently sensational feature of jookin is the extensive use of what a ballet observer is bound to call pointwork : the men , in sneakers , go onto tiptoe ... many of the men not only rose onto point but also hopped , turned , ran and balanced on point . \" Jookers have traditionally practiced their moves at the Crystal Palace skating rink in Memphis , which is akin to how milongueros practice their moves in public spaces in Buenos Aires ."

However , since there is no possible algorithm that can determine which aspect — the stereotype or the reference — has changed in a particular case , it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language .

The disturbance gradually intensified throughout much of its early formative stages , attaining tropical storm strength on September 10 ; further strengthening into a hurricane north of Puerto Rico occurred two days later . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane recurved northward , and reached peak intensity the following day as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of at least 988 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 18 inHg ) . The cyclone steadily weakened thereafter before making landfall on Nova Scotia on September 17 with winds of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) . Moving into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence later that day , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnant system curved eastward and passed over Newfoundland before dissipating over the Atlantic on September 19 ."

Skins also come from horses , and bull skin is preferred for larger drums . Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko , and thicker skins are used for larger ones . On some drumheads , a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance . Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month ; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal . To stretch the skin over the drum properly , one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it . The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks , and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead . Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension . Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes . Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers , clad in stockings , hop rhythmically atop it , forming a circle along the edge .

The first account , in 1718 , is from Houbraken , who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict water in waterfalls and the sea . In 1781 , Sir Joshua Reynolds , founder of the Royal Academy , admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael 's landscapes . A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed . In 1801 , Henry Fuseli , professor at the Royal Academy , expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape , dismissing it as no more than a \" transcript of the spot \" , a mere \" enumeration of hill and dale , clumps of trees \" . Of note is that one of Fuseli 's students was Constable , whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged . Around the same time in Germany , the writer , statesman and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lauded Ruisdael as a thinking artist , even a poet , saying \" he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind \" . John Ruskin however , in 1860 , raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists , calling their landscapes places where \" we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it \" . In 1915 , the Dutch art historian Abraham Bredius called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet ."

Māori folklore suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the Polynesians first arrived in Aotearoa 700 years ago . Subfossil and midden deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North Island , South Island and Stewart Island / Rakiura before and during early Māori times . Māori hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers , which were made into cloaks . They used the dried heads as ear ornaments . Due to its flightlessness , strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened , the kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs . Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the Polynesian rat or kiore , which the Māori brought to New Zealand . Furthermore , the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo . Although the kakapo was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived , including the Tararua and Aorangi Ranges , it was still present in the central part of the North Island and forested parts of the South Island ."

Though the origins are not clearly known , the Advaita school of Hinduism established by Sankaracharya , attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer .

Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism , namely Saivism and Vaishnavism , the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all Hindu affair . The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime . Traditionally the trip starts at the eastern end from Puri , proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for circuambulation in Hindu temples .

First , Cullhed disputes the first argument , noting that “ there are no ‘ grounds for determining priority ’ ” of the lines . In regards to the second point , Cullhed notes that the supposed reference to the AD 387 debate about Easter could have easily referred to an earlier dispute . Countering the third point , Cullhed notes out that many other scholars feel that Jerome would have never insulted Anicia Proba since he praised her as “ the richest , noblest and most powerful woman in Rome ” in another letter ( this opinion is reiterated by Green ) . In regards to the fourth argument , Cullhed notes that Faltonia Betitia Proba ’ s supposed death in AD 351 may very well be unfounded . Opposing the fifth point , Cullhed argues that the titles used to refer to the author could have been inserted after the fact , sometime in the Middle Ages . Finally , Cullhed brings forth new evidence , arguing that if Anicia Proba had penned De laudibus Christi , it is likely that the Latin poet Claudian would have mentioned her poetic skills in his panegyric that celebrated the joint consulship of Anicia Proba 's two sons , Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Anicius Probinus in AD 395 . Cullhed summarizes her argument by saying : “ The evidence for discrediting Isidore ’ s attribution [ of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the cento 's author ] is not sufficient , and so , I will assume that the cento was written in the mid @-@ fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba . ” Likewise , Karl Schenkl argues that scholars should accept the testimony of Isidore , who clearly attributes De laudibus Christi to Faltonia Betitia Proba .

The Baltimore and Fredericktown Turnpike was completed in 1812 . That same year , keen for an improved road to fully extend between Baltimore and Cumberland , the Maryland General Assembly conscripted the state 's banks to fund turnpike companies to complete the gap between Boonsboro and Cumberland with the benefit of having their charters extended from 1816 to 1835 . The banks opposed this measure but reluctantly bankrolled the construction of a road from Conocheague Creek to Cumberland between 1816 and 1818 and from Hagerstown to Conococheague Creek in 1818 and 1819 . The Maryland General Assembly used their powers again in 1821 , agreeing to extend the banks ' charters to 1845 if they would fund a turnpike in the gap between Boonsboro and Hagerstown . When the National Turnpike was completed in 1823 , it became the first macadam road constructed in the United States . The Baltimore and Fredericktown and National turnpikes remained in operation through 1909 ."

    "text": "His work was disturbed in February 1829 by the unexpected death of his eldest daughter Catherine , who was only four years old . This led him to reconsider his position on religion — previously an agnostic , his interest in Christianity was renewed , and having read the Bible , the works of the theologian William Paley as well as more skeptical works such as Hume 's On Miracles , he came to acknowledge the \" moral truth \" of the gospels , while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity . Despite this personal tragedy , and his own continued ill health , Prescott had gathered sufficient material to begin drafting the History in October 1829 . At around this time , Prescott read the works of Gabriel Bonnot de Mably , including his historiographical piece De l ’ étude de l ’ histoire . He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably 's romantic ideal , and on more than one occasion expressed his indebtedness to him . Prescott also encountered Elogia de la Réina Doña Isabel , by his Spanish contemporary Diego Clemencín , which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs ' political roles . Due to further problems with his eyesight , it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the History . It was largely finished by 1834 , but Prescott dedicated two years to abridging and redrafting it . He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of Charles Brockden Brown for Jared Sparks ' Library of American Biography . Prescott was not familiar with American literature , and he based the work on other contemporary biographies of Brown . As a result , the biography has had little academic impact .

Under this scheme , as articulated by the Assembly , God 's dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants : the covenant of works and covenant of grace . The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works ( sometimes called the covenant of life ) , in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience . In the fall of man , Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil . To remedy this , God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace . This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God 's law perfectly . The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology . The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people ."

Malcolm asserted that the film \" is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain \" and \" transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making . \" In 2005 , J. Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film \" ... has long been a cult item – in part because its talented 25 @-@ year @-@ old director , Michael Reeves , died of a drug overdose before [ sic ] the film 's release , but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil ...

    "text": "Translesion synthesis ( TLS ) is a DNA damage tolerance process that allows the DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites . It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases ( i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V , from the Y Polymerase family ) , often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides . The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by , among other factors , the post @-@ translational modification of the replication processivity factor PCNA . Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity ( high propensity to insert wrong bases ) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases . However , many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage . For example , Pol η mediates error @-@ free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation , whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites . Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T ^ T photodimer using Watson @-@ Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using Hoogsteen base pairing . From a cellular perspective , risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair , which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death . In short , the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication . For example , Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine @-@ thymine intra @-@ strand crosslink , G [ 8 @,@ 5 @-@ Me ] T , although can cause targeted and semi @-@ targeted mutations . Paromita Raychaudhury and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a G [ 8 @,@ 5 @-@ Me ] T @-@ modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts . Viability was very low in a strain lacking pol II , pol IV , and pol V , the three SOS @-@ inducible DNA polymerases , indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases . A bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) . Under normal circumstances , PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA . At a site of lesion , PCNA is ubiquitinated , or modified , by the RAD6 / RAD18 proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication . After translesion synthesis , extension is required . This extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error @-@ free , as in the case of Pol η , yet if TLS results in a mismatch , a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it ; Pol ζ . Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches , whereas more processive polymerases cannot . So when a lesion is encountered , the replication fork will stall , PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion , then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch , and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication ."

Also , as can be seen from a survey of famous Freemasons , individual Freemasons hold beliefs that span the spectrum of politics . The term \" Masonic government \" has no meaning since individual Freemasons hold many different opinions on what constitutes a good government ."

These figures spin Wyrd , which refers to the actions and interrelationships of all beings throughout the cosmos . In the community , these three figures are sometimes termed \" Past , Present and Future \" , \" Being , Becoming , and Obligation \" or \" Initiation , Becoming , Unfolding \" . It is believed that an individual can navigate through the Wyrd , and thus , the Heathen worldview oscillates between concepts of free will and fatalism . Heathens also believe in a personal form of Wyrd known as örlög . This is connected to an emphasis on luck , with Heathens in the U.S. often believing that luck can be earned , passed down generations , or lost ."

In that case , the European Court of Human Rights accepted that the right to try to persuade another of one 's own religious beliefs is included in the \" right to manifest [ one 's ] religion or belief \" provided for by Article 9 ( 1 ) of the European Convention on Human Rights . However , this right is not void of limitations . Article 9 ( 2 ) of the Convention prescribes limitations to the freedom to manifest one 's religion \" in the interests of public safety , for the protection of public order , health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others \" . The Court clarified that Article 9 ( 1 ) does not protect improper proselytism , such as when one offers material or social advantages to entice another to adopt certain religious beliefs , or when one applies improper pressure with a view to gaining new members for a religious group . On the facts of the case , the Court found that Article 9 had not been infringed by the prosecution of three air force officers for proselytizing to their subordinates , since the hierarchical nature of military life meant it was difficult for a subordinate to rebuff the approaches of persons of superior rank . Thus , a conversation which might be regarded as a harmless exchange of ideas in a civilian context could be seen in a military setting as harassment or the imposition of undue pressure in abuse of power ."

Norwegian immigration started about 1850 , and the first land was granted land for farming in 1874 , after a road was built along the valley to Svanvatn . This was followed up by Russian immigration to the other side of the border . The road was extended to Grensefossen in 1939 and after 1945 the population on the Russian side was forcefully moved by the Soviet authorities and the area depopulated . The Soviet Union started planning to regulate Pasvikelva for hydroelectricity in the 1940s , with the first power station opening in 1951 . Seven power stations were built which take advantage of the entire height of fall in the river ."

The latter presented a new challenge for the development team : while they found adjusting to the new specifications a challenge , they also greatly enjoyed working with the Sega Saturn , the which was unlike anything previously experienced by the team . Among the design staff were Katsura Hashino , who focused on combat , and Shogo Isogai , who focused on coordination between gameplay events . The demon conversation system was conceived by Okada based on experiences with the multiple accents encountered in the Kansai region of Japan . Using this as a base , he created the response system to give demon negotiation a more realistic feeling than previous Megami Tensei games . It was also a means of equalizing the relationship between demons and the player party , which had previously been more akin to master and servant than equal partners . The Zoma demons , which could be freely tailored into different demon types , was created while the team was balancing out the game 's difficulty . The gameplay difficulty , which by later standards would be considered quite high , was toned down from the difficulty of earlier Megami Tensei titles to appeal to a wider audience . This necessitated balancing a more forgiving difficulty with keeping traditional Megami Tensei gameplay elements ."

The hemmema was initially developed for use against the Russian Navy in the Archipelago Sea and along the coasts of Svealand and Finland . It was designed by the prolific and innovative Swedish naval architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman ( 1721 – 1808 ) in collaboration with Augustin Ehrensvärd ( 1710 – 1772 ) , an artillery officer and later commander of the Swedish archipelago fleet . The hemmema was a specialized vessel for use in the shallow waters and narrow passages that surround the thousands of islands and islets extending from the Swedish capital of Stockholm into the Gulf of Finland ."

The great diversity of ant fossils found in the Baltic amber and Florissant shales of the Oligocene and in the Sicilian amber of the Miocene have prompted entomologists to search for ants of Cretaceous age that may link ants and non @-@ social wasps together . Such a link may shed light on the early origins of ants , but no fossils of any social insect existed before S. freyi was discovered , thus the early evolution of ants remained a mystery . Only a single hymenopterous Upper Cretaceous fossil has been the subject of possible significance to the evolution of aculeate wasps and ants . A single forewing was discovered in Siberia and described in 1957 as Cretavus sibiricus , with the author noting that the wing ventation closely resembles those of bethylid or scoliid wasps , of which these families of wasps have close connections with the origin of ants . However , there were several problems : as the fossil was only a single wing , scientists could not explain or answer whether or not the insect had key diagnostic body traits that would even place it within the subclade Aculeata ."

This surplus stimulates the activity of osteoclasts , cells that break down bone , in a process known as osteoclastic bone resorption . The hyperparathyroidism can be triggered by a parathyroid adenoma , hereditary factors , parathyroid carcinoma , or renal osteodystrophy . Osteoclastic bone resorption releases minerals , including calcium , from the bone into the bloodstream . In addition to elevated blood calcium levels , over @-@ activity of this process results in a loss of bone mass , a weakening of the bones as their calcified supporting structures are replaced with fibrous tissue ( peritrabecular fibrosis ) , and the formation of cyst @-@ like brown tumors in and around the bone . The symptoms of the disease are the consequences of both the general softening of the bones and the excess calcium in the blood , and include bone fractures , kidney stones , nausea , moth @-@ eaten appearance in the bones , appetite loss , and weight loss ."

The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts , and wanted to sideline them completely .

The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production , which encouraged a system of cross @-@ regional trade . In the late @-@ 18th century , the Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system ; mechanisation enabled the industrialisation of the region 's textile trade , triggering rapid growth in the cotton industry and expansion in ancillary trades . Infrastructure such as rows of terraced housing , factories and roads were constructed to house labour , transport goods , and produce cotton goods on an industrial scale for a global market . The townships in and around Manchester began expanding \" at an astonishing rate \" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in industrial textile production and processing . This population increase resulted in the \" vigourous concentric growth \" of a conurbation between Manchester and an arc of surrounding mill towns , formed from a steady acretion of houses , factories and transport infrastructure .

For women with injuries above T6 , a risk during labor and delivery that threatens both mother and fetus is autonomic dysreflexia , in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke . Drugs such as nifedipine and captopril can be used to manage an episode if it occurs , and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI . Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation , who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort , increased spasticity , and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia . Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery ; in fact , they may fail to realize when they go into labor . If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary .

The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral . After this , the four rejoined de Broc and searched the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents that de Broc was to send to the king . The party then returned to Saltwood ."

He was also one of the four artists representing Singapore at the 2007 Venice Biennale . He presented an installation , Untitled , consisting of two beds positioned upright , the trunks of plantain trees , a portable ancestral altar , a handmade album of drawings and photographs , and other found objects . Drawings of people and faces were strapped to the beds and wrapped around the tree trunks . The installation was accompanied by a recording by Tang 's son , Zai Tang , of sounds captured in Venice during a single day . The work was described by the National Arts Council as suggestive of \" the restlessness , rootlessness , spiritual wandering and emotional estrangement that mark the travelling life \" . In 2007 , a work by Tang consisting of ink paintings around a well , and representing the erosion of village communities by urban development , was acquired by the Queensland Art Gallery for its Gallery of Modern Art . From January to June 2016 , Tang presented Earth Work 1979 at the National Gallery Singapore , a re @-@ staging of his 1979 exhibition , the first recorded instance of Singapore land art . The exhibition includes \" Gully Curtains \" , where Tang placed large pieces of fabric between gullies and let the rain and sun mark the fabric . His work Tiger 's Whip ( 1991 ) is also displayed at the National Gallery 's DBS Singapore Gallery ."

Popular CBS anchor Walter Cronkite stated during a news broadcast on February 27 , \" We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders , both in Vietnam and Washington , to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds \" and added that , \" we are mired in a stalemate that could only be ended by negotiation , not victory . \" Far from suffering a loss of morale , however , the majority of Americans had rallied to the side of the president . A Gallup poll in January 1968 revealed that 56 percent polled considered themselves hawks on the war and 27 percent doves , with 17 percent offering no opinion . By early February , at the height of the first phase of the offensive , 61 percent declared themselves hawks , 23 percent doves , and 16 percent held no opinion . Johnson , however , made few comments to the press during or immediately after the offensive , leaving an impression of indecision on the public . It was this lack of communication that caused a rising disapproval rating for his conduct of the war . By the end of February , his approval rating had fallen from 63 percent to 47 percent .

Most bites are caused by female spiders ; the male katipo was considered too small to cause systemic envenoming in humans . However , bites from male redback spiders have been reported suggesting male Latrodectus spiders can cause envenoming in humans .

Māori legends recall many deaths , the last of which appears to have been a Māori girl who – according to the missionary Thomas Chapman – died in approximately 1849 . While there were reports of severe katipo bites in 19th or early 20th century records , no other fatalities from spider bites have since been reported in New Zealand .

Consequently , recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters ."

It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue , so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird , and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains . McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice . He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach , but it proved too clumsy to be practical . When Shackleton 's party set off on 18 May 1916 , McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further . He shook hands with each of the men , wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back . Putting McNish in command of the remaining men , Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast . Once Shackleton 's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik , he sent Worsley with one of the whaler 's ships , Samson , to pick up McNish and the other men .

The cad greets HCE in Gaelic and asks the time , but HCE misunderstands the question as an accusation , and incriminates himself by denying rumours the cad has not yet heard . These rumours quickly spread across Dublin , gathering momentum until they are turned into a song penned by the character Hosty called \" The Ballad of Persse O 'Reilly \" . As a result , HCE goes into hiding , where he is besieged at the closed gate of his pub by a visiting American looking for drink after hours . However HCE remains silent – not responding to the accusations or verbal abuse – dreams , is buried in a coffin at the bottom of Lough Neagh , and is finally brought to trial , under the name Festy King . He is eventually freed , and goes once more into hiding . An important piece of evidence during the trial – a letter about HCE written by his wife ALP – is called for so that it can be examined in closer detail ."

By then , American political thought , transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures , had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates . Americans ' new understanding of popular sovereignty was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation . Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people 's power and only for a limited time . Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics . Yet Wood ignored Adams ' peculiar definition of the term \" republic , \" and his support for a constitution ratified by the people . He also underestimated Adams ' belief in checks and balances , such as Adams ' statement that , \" Power must be opposed to power , and interest to interest . \" This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison 's famous statement that , \" [ a ] mbition must be made to counteract ambition \" , in The Federalist No. 51 , explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution .

While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die , he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park , which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area . Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on , Church admitted that it was not designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service . A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service . In April 1966 , Church introduced two bills , one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area ( SNRA ) . The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan , another Senator from Idaho , because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging , hunting , and grazing .

In fact , the Roman Empire influenced every part of Scotland during the period : by the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410 , the various Iron Age tribes native to the area had united as or fell under the control of the Picts while the southern half of the country was overrun by tribes of Romanized Britons . The Scoti , Gaelic Irish raiders who would give Scotland its English name , had begun to settle along the west coast as well . All three groups may have been involved in the Great Conspiracy that overran Roman Britain in 367 . The era also saw the emergence of the earliest historical accounts of the natives .

Nullification is a legal theory that a state has the right to nullify , or invalidate , any federal law which that state has deemed unconstitutional . In Calhoun 's words , it is \" the right of a State to interpose , in the last resort , in order to arrest an unconstitutional act of the General Government , within its limits . \" Nullification can be traced back to arguments by Jefferson and Madison in writing the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 against the Alien and Sedition Acts . Madison expressed the hope that the states would declare the acts unconstitutional , while Jefferson explicitly endorsed nullification . Calhoun openly argued for a state 's right to secede from the Union , as a last resort , in order to protect its liberty and sovereignty . Madison rebuked supporters of nullification , stating that no state had the right to nullify federal law ."

These regimes were based on the power of a regular army composed of the ghilmān , but in turn , according to Hugh N.

These provided him with the basic material , but not the structure for a staged drama ; the events of Acts 1 and 2 of the libretto are covered by a mere 13 lines in the Metamorphoses .

The critic Barbara Russano Hanning writes that Striggio 's verses are less subtle than those of Rinuccini , although the structure of Striggio 's libretto is more interesting . Rinuccini , whose work had been written for the festivities accompanying a Medici wedding , was obliged to alter the myth to provide a \" happy ending \" suitable for the occasion .

    "text": "Following the Smithsonian Agreement , member states of the European Economic Community adopted a narrower currency band of 1 @.@ 125 % for exchange rates among their own currencies , creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel . The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies . In 1979 , the European Monetary System ( EMS ) phased out the currency snake . The EMS featured two key components : the European Currency Unit ( ECU ) , an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members ' currencies , and the Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) , a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies ' par values . The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system , denominated in terms of ECUs . The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket . Under the ERM , if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit ( within a 2 @.@ 25 % band ) , both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix . The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system . Similarly to Bretton Woods however , EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds , as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU 's value . The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances , and were modified every eight months on average during the systems ' initial four years of operation . During its twenty @-@ year lifespan , these central rates were adjusted over 50 times ."

The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette . When Groening originally designed Homer , he put his own initials into the character 's hairline and ear : the hairline resembled an ' M ' , and the right ear resembled a ' G ' . Groening decided that this would be too distracting though , and redesigned the ear to look normal . He still draws the ear as a ' G ' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans . Marge 's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s , although her hair was never blue . Bart 's original design , which appeared in the first shorts , had spikier hair , and the spikes were of different lengths . The number was later limited to nine spikes , all of the same size . At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and \" not thinking that [ Bart ] would eventually be drawn in color \" gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head . Lisa 's physical features are generally not used in other characters ; for example , in the later seasons , no character other than Maggie shares her hairline . While designing Lisa , Groening \" couldn 't be bothered to even think about girls ' hair styles \" . When designing Lisa and Maggie , he \" just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style , not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color \" . Groening storyboarded and scripted every short ( now known as The Simpsons shorts ) , which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer , both of whom would later become directors on the series ."

In The Conditions of Future South African Literature , his next essay of significance , he dealt with the other significant factor in nation @-@ building - the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community . Within this essay , not at first sight written on an overtly political topic , Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born . The question then arose - what was hindering this development ? Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer - particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population . The relations between these two groups were fraught ; the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population . With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant economic unit of South Africa , but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest , with the established population decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers . These divisions , though strongest in the Transvaal , existed to one degree or another throughout South Africa . Smuts , though sympathising with the concerns of the old population , fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration , urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting . Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old , to consolidate the white population both for the sake of a future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population ."

Gloucester 's attacks on Beaufort forced the latter from public life but brought him little advantage as the earl of Suffolk ’ s influence over the king enabled him to direct policy for the rest of the decade . Gloucester remained heir presumptive but in 1441 his ambitious wife , Eleanor Cobham , consulted astrologers on the likelihood of the king 's death and was arrested for treasonable necromancy — although Gloucester was not implicated he was discredited forced into retirement . In 1447 Suffolk had him arrested and within days he died in prison ."

Finding the first four waves of American soldiers leaderless , disorganized , and pinned down on the open beach , he immediately assumed command .

During the advance , Captain Wai repeatedly determined the locations of enemy strong points by deliberately exposing himself to draw their fire . In leading an assault upon the last remaining Japanese pillbox in the area , he was killed by its occupants .

Ninety @-@ three Dutch prisoners had been removed , and among the remaining Dutch sailors were 76 wounded men . As the gale intensified , it rapidly became clear that despite a tow line attached from Veteran the ship would never reach Britain , and a large board was raised on deck with the chalked message \" The ship is sinking \" . Reacting at once , boats from nearby ships organised an evacuation and began loading the Dutch prisoners for transfer to more seaworthy vessels . Bullen offered a place in the first rescue boat , from Veteran , to Heilberg , but the Dutch officer refused , gesturing to the immobile wounded who had been brought onto the maindeck as the lower decks had flooded and replying \" But how can I leave these men ? \" . In response , Bullen cried out \" God bless you , my brave fellow ! Here is my hand ; I give you my word I will stay her with you ! \" . The prize crew left on the second rescue boat sent from Russell , and Bullen and Heilberg waited for a third trip to bring them off with the remaining 30 wounded men and three junior Dutch officers who had also elected to stay . Before further help could arrive , however , Delft suddenly foundered , Bullen and Heilberg throwing themselves clear as the ship sank .

In practice , this meant that his verse was usually unrhymed and consisted of ten syllables to a line , spoken with a stress on every second syllable . The blank verse of his early plays is quite different from that of his later ones . It is often beautiful , but its sentences tend to start , pause , and finish at the end of lines , with the risk of monotony . Once Shakespeare mastered traditional blank verse , he began to interrupt and vary its flow . This technique releases the new power and flexibility of the poetry in plays such as Julius Caesar and Hamlet . Shakespeare uses it , for example , to convey the turmoil in Hamlet 's mind :"

Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) to as much as 12 m ( 39 ft ) ; the gouging process , whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark , may be loud enough to be heard up to 10 m ( 33 ft ) away .

As neither the foundation stela nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found , its original name is unknown , but it may have been known as \" Varah Vishnu @-@ lok \" after the presiding deity .

The Crown had for example received a fifth of the large number of slaves taken in the recent Mixtón War , and so could not be held clean of guilt under Las Casas 's strict rules . In 1548 the Crown decreed that all copies of Las Casas 's Confesionario be burnt , and his Franciscan adversary , Motolinia , happily obliged , sending back a report to Spain . Las Casas defended himself by writing two treatises on the \" Just Title \" – arguing that the only legality with which the Spaniards could claim titles over realms in the New World was through peaceful proselytizing . All warfare was illegal and unjust and only through the papal mandate of peacefully bringing Christianity to heathen peoples could \" Just Titles \" be acquired ."

Ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level , the realm of desire . Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone : they see forms but are not drawn to them . Finally , full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest , most fundamental level , the formless ocean of nirvana . The liberation from the cycle of Saṃsāra where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of Śūnyatā , the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self .

The original draft had nine characters ( including the Prince , two love interests , two villains , and two helper characters ) representing different political factions , and the setting of the Prince 's own palace home instead of in another kingdom . This storyline ultimately impeded other aspects of development , and so was scrapped . In starting over , the team returned to the \" The Sands of Time \" title and concept . They decided upon four key elements for the game : \" Unity of time and place \" , with the game taking place over twenty @-@ four hours within the palace of Azad ; \" Acrobatics \" , referring to the gameplay and how the setting was constructed around this concept ; \" Combat \" , with the palace being filled with monsters to give the game and story a fast @-@ paced feeling ; and \" Rewind \" , the ability to turn back and manipulate time . One of the early decisions made by the production team was not to refer to Prince of Persia 3D in any degree in designing the gameplay , instead looking to the 1989 original for reference . They intended to capture the original feeling of platforming an adventure in a 3D environment . The Rewind mechanic began as a gameplay wish for the title , surviving the initial rewrite of the story and becoming key to both story and gameplay . The Dagger of Time and the Sands were both born from the need to explain this mechanic in @-@ game . The initial concept was simply using the Dagger to rewind time and dispatch enemies , but its powers were gradually expanded into its current roster . The main character 's acrobatics were designed to be novel to the video game medium , inspired by similar stunts performed in Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon and The Matrix . A video game which provided inspiration for the acrobatic feats of the Prince was Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater . Elements such as using ladders as part of combat , and riding on a magic carpet or a horse were axed early in development . The Rewind function was suggested by the game 's director Patrice Désilets based on experiences playing Donald Duck : Goin ' Quackers , where he had wished to rewind after making a mistake rather than restarting the entire level ."

Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies ' signature musical style . In 1584 , Alessandro Striggio , responding to requests from Francesco I de ' Medici , Grand Duke of Tuscany , described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne . Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos . He added that he had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua , and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord .

Allmusic 's Greg Prato said that the \" obvious reason for [ the band 's ] rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante \" , considering him to be the \" quintessential RHCP guitarist \" . The album as a whole was \" a bona fide Chili Peppers classic \" . Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band 's sound into a \" more relaxed , less grating , and , in their own way , more introspective album than ever before \" . Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that \" ' This Velvet Glove ' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock , \" Woodlief continued \" the disco intro to ' Parallel Universe ' gives way to a scorching Western giddy @-@ up motif in the chorus , and Frusciante 's Hendrix @-@ like excursions at the song 's close . \""

As governor of Mexico he sent out an expedition of two ships , one guided by the famous pilot Fortún Ximénez who led a mutiny , killing the expedition 's leader , Diego Becerra , and a number of sailors faithful to Becerra . After the mutiny , Ximénez continued sailing north by northwest and , in early 1534 , landed at what is known today as La Paz , Baja California Sur . Ximénez , who reported pearls found , believed the land was a large island . He and his escort of sailors were killed by natives when they went ashore for water . The few remaining sailors brought the ship and its story back to Cortés . There is some dispute whether the land was named at this time — no record exists of Ximénez giving it a name . In 1535 , Cortés led an expedition back to the land , arriving on May 1 , 1535 , a day known as Santa Cruz de Mayo , and in keeping with methods of contemporary discoverers , he named it Santa Cruz . It is not known who first named the area California but between 1550 and 1556 , the name appears three times in reports about Cortés written by Giovanni Battista Ramusio . However , the name California also appears in a 1542 journal kept by explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo , who used it casually , as if it were already popular . In 1921 , California historian Charles E. Chapman theorized that Ximénez named the new land California but the name was not accepted by Cortés because Ximénez was a mutineer who killed Becerra , a kinsman of Cortés . Despite this , the name became the one used popularly by Spaniards , the only name used by non @-@ Spaniards , and by 1770 , the entire Pacific coast controlled by Spain was officially known as California . The Spanish speaking people who lived there were called Californios ."

Within this field , sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical @-@ comparative methods . In contemporary studies of social change , there is overlaps with international development or community development .

He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced . Of his ballets for Sadler 's Wells , The Wise Virgins ( 1940 ) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach . The Quest ( 1943 ) , written in great haste , is , according to Grove , oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams . Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire , unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of Façade , the music for which was expanded for full orchestra , still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original . Music from The Quest and the whole of the Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler 's Wells ballet , O.W. , in 1972 ."

It is also interesting to note that the film 's director , Roland Emmerich , is openly gay . Still there are some curious cases like Cthulhu ( 2007 ) a horror / thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft , in which the main character is gay but it isn 't the main thing , although it is important in the development of the character 's psychology . The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings . Also , in V for Vendetta there are two secondary characters – one gay , one lesbian – shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia . 2012 saw the light of the epic Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster , Cloud Atlas , featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters ."

There it joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade , a garrison formation hurriedly committed from Hong Kong by the British government as the situation deteriorated around the Pusan Perimeter in late August to bolster the US Eighth Army under Lieutenant General Walton Walker . Commanded by Brigadier Basil Coad , the brigade was renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and consisted of the 1st Battalion , Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment ( 1 ASHR ) , the 1st Battalion , Middlesex Regiment ( 1 MR ) and 3 RAR . Understrength , the two British battalions had each mustered just 600 men of all ranks , while the brigade was also short on transport and heavy equipment , and had no integral artillery support , for which it would rely entirely on the Americans until the 16th Field Regiment , Royal New Zealand Artillery arrived in January 1951 . As such , with a strength of nearly 1 @,@ 000 men , the addition of 3 RAR gave the brigade increased tactical weight as well as expediently allowing the Australians to work within a familiar organisational environment , rather than being attached to a US formation . Also under the command of the brigade were a number of US Army units , including 155 mm howitzers from the US 90th Field Artillery Battalion , M4 Sherman tanks from US 89th Tank Battalion and a company from the US 72nd Combat Engineer Battalion ."

    "text": "In selectively logged eucalypt forests in the central highlands of Victoria , it has been estimated that about 3 – 5 % of the forest area is \" moderately to severely affected \" by Armillaria root rot caused by A. luteobubalina . A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by A. luteobubalina was rare , and only accounted for 1 % of mortality in total . In this instance , the cases had been restricted to Eucalyptus nitens on the Dorrigo Plateau . Unlike other Armillaria species found in Australia 's native forests , which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species , A. luteobubalina is a primary pathogen , and can infect healthy trees . Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above @-@ ground symptoms , making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a forest stand . Surveys are usually conducted in autumn , to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies ; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars on the trees , and the appearance of fruit bodies . Several factors , however — such as cost , variable on @-@ site conditions , and non @-@ symptomatic diseased trees — make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections . One study showed that above @-@ ground examinations detected only 50 % of the trees actually infected , leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20 – 40 % . The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30 @-@ year @-@ old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40 – 45 % incidence of infection ."

Kingsley published a defense of slavery in 1828 , identifying himself only as \" An Inhabitant of Florida \" . He rationalized the institution as a necessary condition for any society , beneficial to owner and slave alike , and to the overall economy . He did not consider race the only factor that should determine servitude status , writing , \" Few , I think will deny that color and condition , if properly considered , are two very separate qualities ... our legislators ... have mistaken the shadow for the substance , and confounded together two very different things ; thereby substantiating by law a dangerous and inconvenient antipathy , which can have no better foundation than prejudice . \" In 1823 President James Monroe appointed Kingsley to Florida 's Territorial Council , where he tried to persuade them to define the rights of free people of color . When it became apparent to him that they could not , he resigned . The council passed laws that increasingly restricted the rights which free blacks enjoyed under Spanish control . The treatise was Kingsley 's response to these restrictions ; he favored the Spanish three @-@ tier system of white landowners , black slaves , and freed blacks .

The motion came after a proposal that fifteen refugees be accepted into the municipality , an idea Olsson disliked . It has been speculated that the reason behind the motion was not these fifteen refugees , a small number for the municipality , but , instead , Olsson 's idea to create a protest against Sweden 's positive stance on refugees . Despite heavy protests from most of the country , Sjöbo 's municipal assembly decided in October 1987 to go through with the referendum in 1988 . If the referendum passed , it would completely ban Sjöbo from accepting foreign refugees ."

The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s , with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula ' vanish ' on stage .

It is also the most usual technique where no tracks have been prepared . With this technique , each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion , alternating foot to foot . With the \" diagonal stride \" variant the poles are planted alternately on the opposite side of the forward @-@ striding foot ; with the \" kick @-@ double @-@ pole \" variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride . At times , especially with gentle descents , double poling is the sole means of propulsion . On uphill terrain , techniques include the \" side step \" for steep slopes , moving the skis perpendicular to the fall line , the \" herringbone \" for moderate slopes , where the skier takes alternating steps with the skis splayed outwards , and , for gentle slopes , the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles ."

The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes . Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels , the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism . The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) , which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998 , but progress is slow . In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) with an original target to implement this by 2008 . In 2006 the government re @-@ affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation , and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011 , with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year ."

The two valence electrons give beryllium a + 2 oxidation state and thus the ability to form two covalent bonds ; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in BeCl2 . Due to the octet rule , atoms tend to seek a valence of 8 in order to resemble a noble gas . Beryllium tries to achieve a coordination number of 4 because its two covalent bonds fill half of this octet . A coordination of 4 allows beryllium compounds , such as the fluoride or chloride , to form polymers ."

Cibber 's verses had few admirers even in his own time , and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully that he did not think much of them . His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces incumbent on him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn , and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous parodies , some of which Cibber claimed in his Apology to have written himself .

Most of the players involved were traded to other teams , and since then all the players , minus Artest , have retired . The Pistons advanced to four straight Eastern Conference Finals after the brawl , and six straight overall , making them the first team since the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s to advance to six straight conference finals though they only won the championship once in that streak . However , after losing to the Pistons in the 2005 playoffs , the Pacers failed to finish above .500 until the 2011 – 12 season and missed the playoffs for five straight seasons from 2006 through 2010 . Many Pacers from the 2004 – 05 season believe that the brawl and its consequences ruined a potential championship team , with Artest as the cause . The Pacers have attempted to rebuild by obtaining \" character guys \" as players ."

Individuals have home ranges ; bulls have territories as large as 50 km2 ( 19 sq mi ) , whereas females ' ranges are 10 – 15 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 8 sq mi ) . The ranges of females appear to be spaced apart ; males ' ranges often overlap . No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting . Marking their territories is done by scraping soil with their feet , bending saplings into distinctive patterns , and leaving excrement . The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating , at dawn , and just after dusk . During the day , they wallow in mud baths to cool down and rest . In the rainy season , they move to higher elevations ; in the cooler months , they return to lower areas in their range . When mud holes are unavailable , the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns . The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from ectoparasites and other insects . Captive specimens , deprived of adequate wallowing , have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins , suppurations , eye problems , inflamed nails , and hair loss , and have eventually died . One 20 @-@ month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time . After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow , the rhino will abandon it . Typically , the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food . Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day , the study of wild animals found 80 – 300 minutes ( an average of 166 minutes ) per day spent in wallows ."

The announcement led to a rush of recruits to the Guards ; on 31 October their number was 100 – 150 , 342 on 30 November 1917 and 375 on 26 January 1918 . There were two parts to the Workers ' Guards since May 1917 , most of them being Security Guards . The minority were Red Guards ; partly secret groups formed in industrialized towns and industrial centres including Helsinki , Kotka , Tampere , Turku , Viipuri and the Kymenlaakso area , on the model of the domestic Red Guards built up during 1905 – 1906 in Finland ."

As the lowest @-@ ranking emperor , Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents . Until the end of the Persian war in 299 , he had not even had a major palace . Lactantius states that Galerius hungered for a higher position in the imperial hierarchy . Galerius 's mother , Romula , was bitterly anti @-@ Christian , for she had been a pagan priestess in Dacia , and loathed the Christians for avoiding her festivals . Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war , Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch , when Diocletian had forced him to walk at the front of the imperial caravan , rather than inside it . His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance ; from 302 on , he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians . Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti @-@ Christian clique of counsellors , these suggestions must have carried great force ."

Another settlement known as Ugwu Alfred ( Igbo : Alfred 's Hill ) or \" Alfred 's Camp \" , inhabited by an Alfred Inoma ( a leader of indigenous labourers from Onitsha ) and his labourers , was located on a hillside .

The first coal mine in the Enugu area was the Udi mine opened in 1915 which was shut down two years later and replaced with the Iva Valley mine . Enugu became a major coal mining area and the only significant one in West Africa . The Eastern Line railway connecting Enugu with Port Harcourt was completed in 1916 in order to export the coal through its seaport of which the city was created for this purpose . Enugu became one of the few cities in West Africa created out of contact with Europeans . By 1916 parts of Enugu reserved for Europeans were set up by the colonial government . The area now known as the Government Reserved Area ( GRA ) became the European Quarters located north of the Ogbete River ; alongside this was a section developed for African residents located south of the river . The built @-@ up area of Enugu comprised these two areas , and by 1917 the city officially gained township status .

High pitch is a positive aesthetic value , so a performer will pitch songs at the very top of his or her vocal range . For this reason , the idea of a song 's key has value in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer . Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys , requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players . Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a \" controlled nasal tone \" . Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs , in a way that is \" slower \" and \" wider \" than vibrato used in Western performances . The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression zi zheng qiang yuan , meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely , and the melodic passages should be weaving , or \" round \" ."

Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection , undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science . Intelligent design proponents , they say , are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer 's abilities , parameters , or intentions ( which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence ) , as well as denying the very distinction between natural / artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature ."

Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land . The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades . The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially , causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades . By the 1990s , the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment . The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre @-@ drainage conditions as possible . It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history ."

She idealizes Black men , especially in \" A Zorro Man \" and \" To a Man \" ; she dedicates Diiie to the subjects of both poems . DeGout views \" A Zorro Man \" as an example of Angelou 's ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse and the \" textured liberation \" she places in all her poetry . The use of concrete imagery and abstract symbolism to describe emotional and sexual experience , but also has another meaning , that of liberation from painful and poignant memories . According to DeGout , \" A Zorro Man \" lacks the clear themes of liberation that Angelou 's later poems such as \" Phenomenal Woman \" have , but its subtle use of themes and techniques infer the liberation theme and compliment her poems that are more overtly liberating . The poem and others in Diiie , with its focus on women 's sexual and romantic experiences , challenges the gender codes of poetry written in previous eras . She also challenges the male @-@ centered and militaristic themes and messages found in the poetry of the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s . Angelou 's use of sexual imagery , from a woman 's point of view , provides new interpretations \" and excavates it from derogatory assessments \" . Although the poem 's speaker feels trapped , women 's sexuality is depicted as powerful and controls her partner , which moves away from \" the patriarchal assumption of male control over the sexual act \" . Angelou 's depiction allows her readers , mostly women , to identify , celebrate , and universalize their sexuality to all races . DeGout states that \" A Zorro Man \" \" enact [ s ] empowerment by liberating the reader from stigmas placed on women 's sexuality from gender assumptions of male ( sexual ) power , and from racialized notions of women 's experience \" ."

Finally , slaveowners used the Sambo stereotype to alleviate their own fears and anxieties about the potential rebelliousness of their slaves . Blassingame remarks , \" In this regard , Nat , the actual and potential rebel , stands at the core of white perceptions of the slave .
