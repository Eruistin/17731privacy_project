This requirement , known as the forty shilling freehold , was never adjusted for inflation ; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time . The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute ; on rare occasions women had been able to vote in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership . Nevertheless , the vast majority of people were not entitled to vote ; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200 @,@ 000 . Furthermore , the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly . The smallest counties , Rutland and Anglesey , had fewer than 1 @,@ 000 voters each , while the largest county , Yorkshire , had more than 20 @,@ 000 . Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times ; there was usually no need to live in a constituency in order to vote there ."

The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo , having made at least ten depictions , often showing it in the lower corners . A famous painting of his from 1626 , now called Edwards 's Dodo as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards , has since become the standard image of a dodo .

    "text": "Several early stone keeps had been built after the conquest , with somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100 , and more followed in the 12th century until around 100 had been built by 1216 . Typically these were four sided designs with the corners reinforced by pilaster buttresses . Keeps were up to four storeys high , with the entrance on the first storey to prevent the door from being easily broken down . The strength of the design typically came from the thickness of the walls : usually made of rag @-@ stone , as in the case of Dover Castle , these walls could be up to 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 metres ) thick . The larger keeps were subdivided by an internal wall while the smaller versions , such as that at Goodrich , had a single , slightly cramped chamber on each floor . Stone keeps required skilled craftsmen to build them ; unlike unfree labour or serfs , these men had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive . They were also relatively slow to erect – a keep 's walls could usually only be raised by a maximum of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 metres ) a year , the keep at Scarborough was typical in taking ten years to build ."

He stopped 72 shots , en route to a 5 – 4 quadruple overtime victory , one save shy of Kelly Hrudey 's 73 @-@ save mark set in 1987 . Luongo went on to win his first playoff series as the Canucks eliminated the Stars in seven games . They were , however , defeated in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champions , the Anaheim Ducks . Luongo put forth a losing 56 @-@ save performance in the deciding fifth game against the Ducks . After the game ended in regulation at a 1 – 1 tie , he missed the first three minutes of the first overtime period to what was first believed to be an equipment malfunction . However , after the series ended , it was revealed that Luongo , instead , had an untimely case of diarrhea . The Canucks lost the game 2 – 1 in the second overtime when Luongo took his eye off the puck to look at the referee , believing a penalty should have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward Jannik Hansen was hit by Ducks forward Rob Niedermayer . With Luongo not paying attention , Ducks defenceman Scott Niedermayer shot the puck from the point to score the series @-@ winning goal ."

There would be multiple rings of defensive walls , one inside the other , with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured . If assailants made it past the first line of defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall ."

Ross and comic book author Paul Dini initially planned to revive the former Batgirl Barbara Gordon using an updated version of the character 's original costume , with red accents in place of the traditional yellow .

These photons cause the electron to shift about in a jittery fashion ( known as zitterbewegung ) , which results in a net circular motion with precession . This motion produces both the spin and the magnetic moment of the electron . In atoms , this creation of virtual photons explains the Lamb shift observed in spectral lines ."

He felt the characteristic of the sound was representative of his state of mind .

In this short story , written in August 1921 and first published in November 1933 , Atal , now an adult , becomes an apprentice to Barzai the Wise and travels with him to seek out the tale 's eponymous deities . Barzai even mentions the law against killing cats in Ulthar , further cementing the connection . Atal also appears as a priest in the long The Dream @-@ Quest of Unknown Kadath — written in 1927 but not published until 1943 — when protagonist Randolph Carter visits the city 300 years after the events in The Cats of Ulthar , when the town is still heavily populated by felines . Carter is later able to summon the cats of Ulthar to his aid . Cats would be used in what scholar Katharine M. Rogers calls \" a more original way \" in Lovecraft 's 1923 work The Rats in the Walls . Here , as in others of Lovecraft later tales , cats embody the attraction to horror while , unlike the human protagonists , \" never pursuing horror to the point of becoming horrible themselves \" . The text of The Cats of Ulthar , like many of Lovecraft 's works , has fallen into the public domain and can be accessed in several compilations of the author 's work as well as on the Internet ."

However , it is also a historical account , making use of real documents and accounts of people who knew Francia . Roa 's portrayal of a despot in Latin American fiction is distinguished \" not only by the quantity of detail lavished on him , but by his remarkable capacity to seem at one moment a person , at another an embodiment of contradictory elements not usually associated with a single person , let alone a powerful tyrant \" . Its title was derived from the fact that Francia referred to himself as \" El Supremo \" or \" the Supreme \" . Making use of non @-@ traditional writing techniques , the novel is composed of separate discourses with their own distinctive styles , and the demarcation between them is often blurred . Gerald Martin claims that Roa Bastos 's novel \" was more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since One Hundred Years of Solitude , and critics seemed to suspect that its strictly historical importance might be even greater than that of García Márquez 's fabulously successful creation . \""

The engine separation thus could only have come from an internal failure . From an examination of the detached engine the NTSB concluded that the pylon attachment had separated as the result of damage incurred before the crash . Investigators looked at the aircraft 's maintenance history and found that its most recent service was eight weeks before the crash , during which this particular engine had been removed from the aircraft for repairs . The pylon , the rigging holding the engine onto the wing , had been damaged during the procedure . The procedure recommended by McDonnell @-@ Douglas called for the engine to be removed from the pylon before detaching the pylon itself , but American Airlines , along with Continental Airlines and United Airlines , had begun to use a procedure that saved approximately 200 man @-@ hours per aircraft and \" more importantly from a safety standpoint , it would reduce the number of disconnects ( of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines , electrical cables , and wiring ) from 72 to 27 . \" The new procedure involved mechanics removing the engine and pylon as a single unit .

The line was reinforced with new pillboxes in 1940 as the fortifications were outdated . The line was located at the extreme eastern edge of the area lying below sea level . This allowed the ground before the fortifications to be easily inundated with a few feet of water , too shallow for boats , but deep enough to turn the soil into an impassable quagmire . The area west of the New Holland Water Line was called Fortress Holland ( Dutch : Vesting Holland ; German : Festung Holland ) , the eastern flank of which was also covered by Lake IJssel and the southern flank protected by the lower course of three broad parallel rivers : two effluents of the Rhine , and the Meuse ( or Maas ) . It functioned as a National Redoubt , which was expected to hold out a prolonged period of time , in the most optimistic predictions as much as three months without any allied assistance , even though the size of the attacking German force was strongly overestimated .

Pompée was temporarily abandoned in the yard , her crew redistributed to work on the rest of the squadron .

No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius . Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession \" Nefercheres → Sisires → Cheres \" for the mid Fifth Dynasty . Nefercheres and Cheres are believed to be the hellenized forms for Neferirkare and Neferkhare ( that is Neferefre ) , respectively .

( Young , Hugenberg , Bernstein , & Sacco 2009 ) . Racially ambiguous faces get more racial bias than white faces and less racial bias than black faces , acting as an intermediate , on average . There is evidence for the implicit associations of slight differences in facial features . The degree to which racially ambiguous faces appeared most in line with the prototypical representation of a race , either black or white , directly activated and impacted the evaluations of participants associated with the respective group .

In contrast , \" Nythod Cacwn \" is a comedic song , based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach . It features lyrics that were \" made up on the spot \" by Rhys . \" Dacw Hi \" is inspired by one of Rhys 's former teachers who claimed she had eyes in the back of her head . \" Sarn Helen \" is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales . \" Ymaelodi Â 'r Ymylon \" is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums . The track 's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom \" y cythraul canu \" , which means \" the demon in music \" and refers to the friction this can create between people ."

For this reason , it is believed that the original name had an initial h @-@ sound , a fact that has led Serbian scholar Ljubinko Radenković to reject the etymology given by several dictionaries , including that of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts , by which the demon ’ s name comes from the Turkish word ‘ ala ’ ( snake ) as that word lacks the h @-@ sound . The name may instead stem from the Greek word for hail , χάλαζα ( pronounced [ ˈxalaza ] ; transliterated chalaza ) . This etymology is proposed by Bulgarian scholar Ivanichka Georgieva , and supported by Bulgarian scholar Rachko Popov and Serbian scholars Slobodan Zečević , and Sreten Petrović . According to Serbian scholar Marta Bjeletić , ala and hala stem from the noun * xala in Proto @-@ South @-@ Slavic , the dialect of Proto @-@ Slavic from which South Slavic languages emerged ( x in xala represents the voiceless velar fricative ) .

By 1930 , Routes 206 and 31 was shifted off of Bridge Street , running along a partially completed bypass of Somerville .

This work , a jargon @-@ laden religious treatise in which Vane wanders between literal and symbolic interpretation of Biblical scriptures , was treated by contemporaries and later analysts , including David Hume , as \" absolutely unintelligible \" and \" cloudily formed \" . The same year , after Cromwell called for a fast day to consider methods by which his government might be improved , Vane wrote A Healing Question . In this more carefully structured political work , he proposed a new form of government , insisting as before upon a Parliament supreme over the Army . He was encouraged to publish it by Charles Fleetwood , who had shown it to Cromwell . In a postscript to the work Vane wrote the words \" the good old cause \" , a coinage that became a rallying cry in the next few years for Vane 's group of republicans ."

This period ran from September 30 until October 6 , due to the newly instituted early voting policy . On August 13 , 2008 , Brunner ordered county election board officials to establish procedures to enable voters who register to be immediately issued an absentee ballot . Because a voter could show up with only a cell phone bill , give any four digits and claim they were the last four digits of his or her Social Security Number , and then immediately vote and have such ballots put into the same pool as other votes with no procedure for more rigorous scrutiny of their validity , the Republican Party opposed the same day voting plan and fought it in several Ohio Courts .

On September 29 , 2008 ( a day after lower state and federal courts overruled GOP objections to same @-@ day registration and voting or GOP requests for mandated ballot segregation and verification ) the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati , Ohio rejected Republican efforts to stop the plan .

In 1916 , the infantry began to move to France while the mounted infantry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks . Australian troops of the ANZAC Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt . The Australians first saw combat during the Senussi uprising in the Libyan Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties . The ANZAC Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani between 3 and 5 August 1916 against the Turks who were eventually pushed back . Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal . Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February ."

There , he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott , beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936 – 37 . After this , Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d 'Artus , near Huelgoat , Finistère . In addition to bringing many British archaeologists to work on the site , he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project , coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar . Meanwhile , Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec , near Quimper . In July 1939 , the project focused its attention on Normandy , with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair .

For example , before selecting extramarital sexual partners , men sometimes survey their peers to determine whether their potential partners are likely to have exposed themselves to the virus .

    "text": "The etymology of the word dodo is unclear . Some ascribe it to the Dutch word dodoor for \" sluggard \" , but it is more probably related to Dodaars , which means either \" fat @-@ arse \" or \" knot @-@ arse \" , referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end . The first record of the word Dodaars is in Captain Willem Van West @-@ Zanen 's journal in 1602 . The English writer Sir Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word dodo in print in his 1634 travelogue , claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese , who had visited Mauritius in 1507 . Another Englishman , Emmanuel Altham , had used the word in a 1628 letter , in which he also claimed the origin was Portuguese . The name \" dodar \" was introduced into English at the same time as dodo , but was only used until the 18th century . As far as is known , the Portuguese never mentioned the bird . Nevertheless , some sources still state that the word dodo derives from the Portuguese word doudo ( currently doido ) , meaning \" fool \" or \" crazy \" . It has also been suggested that dodo was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird 's call , a two @-@ note pigeon @-@ like sound resembling \" doo @-@ doo \" ."

He describes \" ... these metasites have also been used to correct continuity errors that have appeared within the television show . For example , following the broadcast of the Torchwood episode ‘ Cyberwoman ’ ( 13 November 2006 ) , the official Torchwood website provided information about ‘ The Fall of Torchwood One ’ that attempted to correct – via ‘ additive comprehension ’ – what some fans had regarded as a glaring error in the plot . Fans had asked how the eponymous Cyberwoman was not sucked into the void along with the rest of her kin during the climax to the Doctor Who episode ‘ Doomsday ’ ( 8 July 2006 ) and the site retroactively explained away the problem : ‘ The only exceptions were those being converted with material entirely derived from this side of the void ’ , which allowed the events of ‘ Cyberwoman ’ to take place without contradicting what viewers originally saw in the episode . \""

Originally chemists and physicists had differing views regarding the definition of the atomic weight – both assigned a value of 16 atomic mass units ( amu ) to oxygen , but physicists defined oxygen in terms of the 16O isotope whereas chemists assigned 16 amu to 16O , 17O and 18O isotopes mixed in the proportion that they occur in nature . Finally an agreement between the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics ( IUPAP ) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) brought this duality to an end in 1959 / 60 , both parties agreeing to define the atomic weight of 12C as being exactly 12 amu . This agreement was confirmed by ISO and in 1969 the CIPM recommended its inclusion in SI as a base unit . This was done in 1971 at the 14th CGPM ."

Such a rank is said to be unified or borrowed . For example , an 8 ′ Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4 ′ Octave . When both of these stops are selected and a key ( for example , c ′ ) is pressed , two pipes of the same rank will sound : the pipe normally corresponding to the key played ( c ′ ) , and the pipe one octave above that ( c ′ ′ ) . Because the 8 ′ rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4 ′ pitch , it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4 ′ stop to be added . In this case , the full rank of pipes ( now an extended rank ) is one octave longer than the keyboard ."

Rimsky @-@ Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer ; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects , either by direct quotation or as models for composing fakeloric passages . The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka ( 1804 – 1857 ) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov . Glinka 's sister , Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova , wanted to preserve her brother 's musical legacy in print , and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket . No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music , and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed . While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka 's music to \" correct \" what he saw as compositional flaws , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach . Eventually , Rimsky @-@ Korsakov prevailed . \" Work on Glinka 's scores was an unexpected schooling for me \" , he later wrote . \" Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas ; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka 's style and instrumentation to their last little note ...

The plans called for tolls of NOK 51 for a car and an investment cost of NOK 47 million . The plans were at first nearly discarded by the administration , as they felt it was impossible for a community of 400 people to finance such a large project without other grants . However , it became evident that the administration was spending NOK 2 million per year on the ferry service , and as the ferry soon would have to be replaced , this would increase to NOK 3 to 5 million per year . On 1 October 1990 , the issue was considered by Hordaland Transport Board , which approved the plans . This was followed up by Hordaland County Council on 19 June 1991 , which involved NOK 27 million being financed by debt and NOK 28 to 33 million being financed through reduced subsidies to the ferry ."

    "text": "The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental — depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used , the HAZ can be of varying size and strength . The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role — if the diffusivity is high , the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small . Conversely , a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ . The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well , as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ . Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated , limited amount of heat , resulting in a small HAZ . Arc welding falls between these two extremes , with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input . To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures , the following formula can be used :"

Production of parts and the building of complete gliders continued throughout 1943 , but production schedules continued to fall behind , particularly when the United States Army Air Forces became interested in the glider , requiring a significant number to be completed for Operation Overlord , the airborne landings in Normandy , and a number of others to be used in the Far East . This placed further pressure on GAL and the Hamilcar Production Group , as the USAAF demands would require further production and new flight trials to see if the glider would operate effectively in a tropical climate . In late 1943 the USAAF required 140 Hamilcars , which would be used to transport bulldozers and other construction equipment for airfield building , and in November it was agreed that 50 would be supplied to them by June 1944 . However , the continued slow production of the gliders so concerned the USAAF that it cancelled its requirement in February 1944 ; this meant that American personnel who had been helping with the production of the gliders were withdrawn and production times were further delayed . It also meant that only British airborne forces would utilize the Hamilcar . By January 1944 only 27 Hamilcars had been erected and were ready for use ; a total of 53 had been produced , but the rest were in storage awaiting parts to complete them or to be erected . Finding personnel to erect the gliders , and airfields to store them , continued to be a problem . By June , however , eighty of the gliders had been manufactured and erected and were ready for use in airborne operations , in time for a small number to be used during Operation Tonga , the British airborne landings in Normandy . Production continued throughout the conflict and finally ended in 1946 , with a total of 344 being produced ."

This feature is also referred to in the Preamble to the Cultivated Plant Code which states that \" The purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters or history , but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate to which category it is assigned . \" Fourthly , cultivated plant taxonomy serves a particular community of people : the Botanical Code focuses on the needs of plant taxonomists as they attempt to maintain order and stability for the scientific names of all plants , while the Cultivated Plant Code caters for the needs of people requiring names for plants used in the commercial world of agriculture , forestry and horticulture .

The famous missionary Henry Martyn ( for whom she named her sixth child ) finally convinced her ; but it was the chaplain to the company , Mr. Parson , who first made her aware of her \" human depravity \" and her need for redemption . After her conversion , she was anxious to pursue evangelical missionary work in India , but she first had to persuade the East India Company that its policy of religious neutrality was ill @-@ conceived . Because there was social and political support for missionary programs in Britain , the Company eventually approved her endeavors . Sherwood established schools for both the children of army officers and the local Indian children attached to the camp . The children were often taught in her home , as no buildings were available . The first school began with 13 children and grew to over 40 , with pupils ranging from the very young to adolescents ; uneducated soldiers also attended at times . Sherwood discovered that traditional British teaching materials did not appeal to children raised in India , and therefore wrote her own Indian- and army @-@ themed stories , such as The History of Little Henry and his Bearer ( 1814 ) and The Memoirs of Sergeant Dale , his Daughter and the Orphan Mary ( 1815 ) ."

These routes typically follow mountain ranges or coastlines , sometimes rivers , and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as large stretches of open water . The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees . The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different . A common pattern in North America is clockwise migration , where birds flying North tend to be further West , and flying South tend to shift Eastwards ."

    "text": "Before the twelfth century most Scottish churches had collegiate bodies of clergy who served over a wide area , often tied together by devotion to a particular missionary saint . From this period local lay landholders , perhaps following the example of David I , began to adopt the continental practice of building churches on their land for the local population and endowing them with land and a priest , beginning in the south , spreading to the north @-@ east and then the west , being almost universal by the first survey of the Scottish Church for papal taxation in 1274 . The administration of these parishes was often given over to local monastic institutions in a process known as appropriation . Scotland had little clear diocesan structure before the Norman period . There were bishoprics based on various ancient churches , but some are very obscure in the records and there appear to be long vacancies . From around 1070 , in the reign of Malcolm III , there was a \" Bishop of Alba \" resident at St. Andrews , but it is not clear what authority he had over the other bishops . After the Norman Conquest of England , the Archbishops of both Canterbury and York each claimed superiority over the Scottish church . The church in Scotland attained independent status after the Papal Bull of Celestine III ( Cum universi , 1192 ) by which all Scottish bishoprics except Galloway were formally independent of York and Canterbury . However , unlike Ireland , which had been granted four Archbishoprics in the same century , Scotland received no Archbishop and the whole Ecclesia Scoticana , with individual Scottish bishoprics ( except Whithorn / Galloway ) , became the \" special daughter of the see of Rome \" . It was in practice run by special councils made up of all its bishops , with the bishop of St Andrews emerging as the most important player ."

The specific epithet is the Latin adjective attenuatus \" narrowed \" , and refers to the leaves narrowing towards the base . The species has had a fairly uneventful taxonomic history . It has only two synonyms , and no subspecies or varieties have been published ; George reviewed the variation in form in the species , and felt that the tree and shrub forms differed only in size and hence were not distinct enough to represent separate taxa . In 1840 , John Lindley published a putative new species , Banksia cylindrostachya , in his A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony ; this has now be shown to be a taxonomic synonym of B. attenuata . In 1891 , Otto Kuntze made a failed attempt to transfer Banksia to the new generic name Sirmuellera . In the process he published the name Sirmuellera attenuata , which is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of B. attenuata .

Though Whistler 's painting was different from Ingres ' art in many ways , he was nevertheless an admirer of the French artist , and was inspired by his work . The fan in the model 's hand and the vase on the mantelpiece are oriental elements , and expressions of the Japonisme prevalent in European art at the time . Apart from this , there are few clues for the viewer , and the picture invites a wide variety of individual interpretations . A contemporary review in the newspaper The Times commented that \" Thought and passion are under the surface of the plain features , giving them an undefinable attraction . \" Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler 's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked ."

He recruited a mix of Iroquois and Loyalists estimated to number between two and three hundred by the time he began his campaign in May . One of his objectives was to acquire provisions for his forces and those of John Butler , who was planning operations in the Susquehanna River valley . Brant began his campaign in late May with a raid on Cobleskill , and raided other frontier communities throughout the summer ."

Erwin Chargaff had shown that the base composition of DNA varies by species ( contrary to the tetranucleotide hypothesis ) , and in 1952 Rollin Hotchkiss published his experimental evidence both confirming Chargaff 's work and demonstrating the absence of protein in Avery 's transforming principle . Furthermore , the field of bacterial genetics was quickly becoming established , and biologists were more inclined to think of heredity in the same terms for bacteria and higher organisms . After Hershey and Chase used radioactive isotopes to show that it was primarily DNA , rather than protein , that entered bacteria upon infection with bacteriophage , it was soon widely accepted that DNA was the material . Despite the much less precise experimental results ( they found a not @-@ insignificant amount of protein entering the cells as well as DNA ) , the Hershey – Chase experiment was not subject to the same degree of challenge . Its influence was boosted by the growing network of the phage group and , the following year , by the publicity surrounding the DNA structure proposed by Watson and Crick ( Watson was also a member of the phage group ) .

Hick 's IS / LM ( Investment @-@ Savings / Liquidity preference @-@ Money supply ) model became the basis for decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s .

The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values for interest rates and economic output . The IS / LM model focused on interest rates as the \" monetary transmission mechanism , \" the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment . A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates , which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy . Other economists built on the IS / LM framework .

Their diet is widely varied and depends on the food available . Before the extinction of the thylacine , the Tasmanian devil ate thylacine cubs left alone in dens when their parents were away . This may have helped to hasten the extinction of the thylacine , which also ate devils . They are known to hunt water rats by the sea and forage on dead fish that have been washed ashore . Near human habitation , they can also steal shoes and chew on them , and eat the legs of otherwise robust sheep when they have slipped in wooden shearing sheds , leaving their legs dangling below . Other unusual matter observed in devil scats includes collars and tags of devoured animals , intact echidna spines , pencil , plastic and jeans . Although devils can bite through metal traps , they tend to reserve their strong jaws for escaping captivity rather than breaking into food storage . Due to their relative lack of speed , they can not run down a wallaby or a rabbit , but they can attack animals that have become slow due to illness . They survey flocks of sheep by sniffing them from 10 – 15 m away and attack if the prey is ill . The sheep stamp their feet in a show of strength ."

The government filed an appeal of this decision but was overruled by an Ontario Superior Court decision released on January 6 , 2005 ; however , a subsequent ruling by the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 13 , 2005 granted the government permission to appeal the decision . The government also faced off against 407 ETR in court regarding plate denial around this time ."

Although Elmo Tanner never gained a large reputation as a singer , he was occasionally featured as such with Weems . It was as a vocalist that he made his initial recordings . He recorded a few dozen sides as a soloist for Paramount and Vocalion in 1927 through 1929 . Interestingly , the Paramount discs appeared in the Race record series , and the Vocalion sides were likewise marketed to African Americans . His versatility was noted by Vocalion , who utilized him to provide vocals for jazz outfits such as Jimmie Noone and for more sedate recordings with the Victor Young orchestra and with organist Eddie House . Not having signed an exclusive contract with any recording company , he was able to appear on the prestigious Victor label with Nathaniel Shilkret . In 1928 he formed a duet with Fred Rose as \" The Tune Peddlers \" and appeared on radio stations WLS , KYW , and WBBM ."

Rather , this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample . The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density . One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample : ( 1 ) twists of the material , where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another , rather than aligned ; ( 2 ) splay of the material , where bending occurs perpendicular to the director ; and ( 3 ) bend of the material , where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis . All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty . They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container . The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions . Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices and lipid bilayers ."

Spawning takes place at any time of year , each species having its own characteristic breeding season . In temperate regions , the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies . The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously . In other species , a male and female may come together and form a pair . This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top , placing his arms between those of the female . When she releases eggs into the water , he is induced to spawn . Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning ( day length to indicate the correct time of the year , dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day ) , and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed . In some species , mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water ."

Reflecting on his early secret plan to transform Lonnie Machin into a new Robin , Grant has stated that though he came to appreciate the character of Tim Drake , he occasionally experiences \" twinges of regret that Anarky wasn ’ t chosen as the new sidekick for comics ' greatest hero . \" Grant has also stated that he attempted to distance himself from the direction of Anarky following his termination from DC Comics , and actively tried to avoid learning about the fate of Anarky and other characters he had come to care about . He often found himself disappointed to see how some characters were used or , as he felt , were mismanaged . Grant later joked on his disillusion in the handling of Anarky , \" if you create something that 's close to your heart and you don 't own it , ' Oh woe is me !

However , he had been tempted to author a story featuring Anarky , only reconsidering the idea on the basis that his disassociation from the character had left him unfamiliar with what had become of Anarky 's canonical status at the time ."

The expansion of the Lord Chancellor 's Office he had overseen also gave him greater opportunities to delegate to his subordinates , allowing him more time to spend on committees and inquiries directly influencing the way the government worked . As a result of his power and influence he grew to dislike being opposed in any way , and this led to conflict between him and other heads of department .

On the other hand , Z0 depends on the ratio of the diameters of outer and inner conductors ( Dr ) and will decrease with increasing inner conductor diameter thus increasing the loss . There is a specific value of Dr for which the loss is a minimum and this turns out to be 3 @.@ 6 . For an air dielectric coax this corresponds to a characteristic impedance of 77 Ω . The coax produced during the war was rigid air @-@ insulated pipe , and this remained the case for some time afterwards . The second requirement is for maximum power handling and was an important requirement for radar . This is not the same condition as minimum loss because power handling is usually limited by the breakdown voltage of the dielectric . However , there is a similar compromise in terms of the ratio of conductor diameters . Making the inner conductor too large results in a thin insulator which breaks down at a lower voltage . On the other hand , making the inner conductor too small results in higher electric field strength near the inner conductor ( because the field lines are closer together on the smaller circumference ) and again reduces the breakdown voltage . The ideal ratio , Dr , for maximum power handling turns out to be 1 @.@ 65 and corresponds to a characteristic impedance of 30 Ω in air . The 50 Ω impedance is the geometric mean of these two figures ;"

The Crostis is not a well @-@ maintained pass , and Giro officials had set out a detailed protocol whereby team cars would not follow the race up or down the mountain , and only motorbikes offering wheel changes would be present with the riders . Team managers expressed concern that they would not fully be able to fulfill their duties if not present with the riders like normal , and this was given as the basis of the UCI 's decision . They held that Giro organizers had sufficiently ensured rider safety on the course , but the necessary protocols did not protect the sporting aspect of the race . Thus , the Crostis was eliminated , and the stage was reduced in length from its originally planned length of 210 km ( 130 mi ) . The second @-@ category Tualis climb was added to the route for the day to offset the loss of the Crostis .

In the album ’ s closing track , \" Heatherwood \" , Cox tells of the house he was born in , where he believes he will return to die . \" Strange Lights \" is a song about \" companionship , and facing uncertainty with someone \" . The song was written by guitarist Lockett Pundt , and is based on a dream he had in which himself , Cox , and a third person \" walked into the sun together , knowing it was going to kill us \" , as described by Cox . The idea for the song \" Lake Somerset \" came from a trip Cox took to the zoo while hung over , during which he saw a turtle eating carrots . \" It was cool and adorable … It had this cute neck and was very small . It chewed slowly . \" When video producer James Sumner approached the band to make a music video for \" Lake Somerset \" , Cox told Sumner he \" wanted a video of a turtle eating a piece of pizza . \" Several days later , Sumner posted his video to YouTube ; it consists of a man in a turtle suit eating pizza for four straight minutes .

It was unknown how they could remain stable without breaking up , drifting away or crashing into Saturn . The problem took on a particular resonance at that time because St John 's College , Cambridge had chosen it as the topic for the 1857 Adams Prize .

    "text": "Throughout most of his career Kertész was depicted as the \" unknown soldier \" who worked behind the scenes of photography , yet was rarely cited for his work , even into his death in the 1980s . Kertész thought himself unrecognised throughout his life , despite spending his life in the eternal search for acceptance and fame . Though Kertész received numerous awards for photography , he never felt both his style and work was accepted by critics and art audiences alike . Although , in 1927 , he was the first photographer to have a solo exhibition , Kertész said that it was not until his 1946 exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago , that he first felt he received positive reviews on his work , and often cites this show as one of his finest moments in America . During his stay in America , he was cited as being an intimate artist , bringing the viewer into his work , even when the picture was that of subjects such as the intimidating New York City and even his reproduced work printed after his death received good reviews ; \" Kertész was above all a consistently fine photographer \" . Kertész 's work itself is often described as predominantly utilising light and even Kertész himself said that \" I write with light \" . He was never considered to \" comment \" on his subjects , but rather capture them – this is often cited as why his work is often overlooked ; he stuck to no political agenda and offered no deeper thought to his photographs other than the simplicity of life . With his art 's intimate feeling and nostalgic tone , Kertész 's images alluded to a sense of timelessness which was inevitably only recognised after his death . Unlike other photographers , Kertész 's work gave an insight into his life , showing a chronological order of where he spent his time ; for example , many of his French photographs were from cafés where he spent the majority of his time waiting for artistic inspiration ."

Previous to Thutmose , Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform , with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road . Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple . Thutmose had the fifth pylon built along the temple 's main road , along with a wall to run around the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway . Outside of this , he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall . Between pylons four and five , he had a hypostyle hall constructed , with columns made of cedar wood . This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples , and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh , an Egyptian symbol of creation . Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues , each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt . Finally , outside of the fourth pylon , he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks , although one of them , which now has fallen , was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later . The cedar columns in Thutmose I 's hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III , however at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself .

Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding , an Icelandic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in Stoke City F.C. for £ 6.6m. The club 's new owners appointed the club 's first foreign manager , Icelander Gudjon Thordarson , in November 1999 ."

She was particularly fascinated with Chapter four , \" The Extinct Lemurs \" , and the reconstructions by Nash that accompanied the descriptions of morphology , behavior , and diet . She praised Nash 's artwork as being one of the most enjoyable aspects of the book . The book was hailed as an excellent source for identifying lemur species for both tourists and researchers . The book was also briefly reviewed in College & Research Libraries News by George Eberhart in April 1996 . The review noted Conservation International 's promotion of ecotourism while also providing a count of the book 's illustrations : 35 color plates , 50 distribution maps , and 135 drawings of postures and behaviors ."

For writer David Shipman , he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be , whether it was an uncle , best friend or lover , and \" more than most stars he belonged to the public \" . A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one . Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky ( 1943 ) stated that if it \" weren 't for Cary Grant 's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all \" .

He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity , wealth and virtue , elite and mass , high and low , great and good \" . He states that Grant 's delivery should \" not have worked , but somehow it did \" , commenting : \" As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth , he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has , against all the odds , actually come off . He smiles at us , sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune . He smiles a smile like Gatbsy 's smile . \" Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a \" new and very important symbol \" , a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types , who represented the \" freedom , natural grace , simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan \" , which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America ."

The Brahmin migrants and the Maratha migrants both call themselves \" Deshasthas \" as both groups migrated to Tanjore from the Desh region of Maharashtra , but till today maintain their separate identities , despite the common \" Deshastha \" tag . Today 's Marathi speaking Thanjavur population are descendants of the Marathi speaking immigrants who immigrated to Tamil Nadu in the 17th and 18th centuries . The isolation from their homeland has almost made them culturally and linguistically alien to Brahmins in Maharashtra . For example , Thanjavur Marathi would sound as a strange mixture of Marathi and Tamil to a Maharashtrian in Pune and would hardly be intelligible to him . Likewise a Tanjore Maharashtrian would find it difficult to follow Pune Marathi . Tanjore Maharashtrian Brahmins who call themselves Deshasthas maintain their distinct brahminical identity which can be seen in their religious and wedding customs . Almost all their customs can be traced to the practices conducted by the early Maharashtrian settlers of Tanjore . They belong to two major groups , the Madhwa Deshastha Brahmins and Smartha Deshastha Brahmins . Arranged marriages between these two groups are common . Both these sub @-@ groups do not conduct arranged marriages with the Maratha caste of Tanjavur .

At least one extrasolar planet , WASP @-@ 17b , has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star 's rotation . The period of one revolution of a planet 's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year . A planet 's year depends on its distance from its star ; the farther a planet is from its star , not only the longer the distance it must travel , but also the slower its speed , because it is less affected by its star 's gravity . No planet 's orbit is perfectly circular , and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year . The closest approach to its star is called its periastron ( perihelion in the Solar System ) , whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron ( aphelion ) . As a planet approaches periastron , its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy , just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls ; as the planet reaches apastron , its speed decreases , just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory ."

Fearing the great number of K 'iche ' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q 'umarkaj , he invited the highest lords of the city , Oxib @-@ Keh ( the ajpop ) and Beleheb @-@ Tzy ( the ajpop k 'amha ) to visit him in his camp . As soon as they did so , he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp . The K 'iche ' warriors , seeing their lords taken prisoner , attacked the Spaniards ' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers . At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K 'iche ' lords burnt to death , he then proceeded to burn the entire city ."

On one hand , MacArthur forced through a land reform , gave women the right to vote , removed the emphasis on militarism in the educational system , imposed a constitution that renounced the right to wage war , and sought to club the power of the zaibatsu . On the other hand , MacArthur 's intelligence chief General Charles A. Willoughby , whom MacArthur called \" my lovable fascist \" cultivated connections with former members of the Japanese military and secret police . Like Willoughby , MacArthur believed that Communism was part of a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world and he often complained that too many officials sent out by Washington to help govern Japan were Jewish and thus Communists . MacArthur told the British diplomat Sir Alvary Gascoigne in 1948 that Eisenhower could not be considered a potential president or even a \" good Republican \" because he had \" Jewish blood in his veins \" . Remarks like that led the American Japanologist Michael Schaller to comment : \" Attacking a rival as a Jew was a frequent MacArthur tactic \" ."

The discovery of a complete forelimb ( NCSM 14345 ) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus . The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating . In many of the joints , the bones did not fit together exactly , indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints , as is seen in many living archosaurs . Among other findings , the study suggested that , in a resting position , the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly , the elbow bent , and the claws facing medially ( inwards ) . The shoulder of Acrocanthosaurus was limited in its range of motion compared to that of humans .

At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297 , Roger Bigod , Earl of Norfolk , in his capacity as Marshal of England , objected to a royal summons of military service . Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King ; if the King intended to sail to Flanders , he could not send his subjects to Gascony . In July , Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun , Earl of Hereford and Constable of England , drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances , in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced . Undeterred , Edward requested another lay subsidy . This one was particularly provocative , because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates , rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament . While Edward was in Winchelsea , preparing for the campaign in Flanders , Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax . As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force , the kingdom seemed to be on the verge of civil war . What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge . The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause .

She introduced balls , masques and celebrations designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity . The most elaborate event was the baptism of the future James VI at Stirling Castle in 1566 , organised by her French servant Bastian Pagez . This combined complex imagery , incorporating classical themes of the goddess Astraea and the revival of the classical golden age , with the chivalry of the Round Table . The ceremony was followed by a banquet , hunts , feasting , poetry , dance and theatre , cumulating in a staged siege and fireworks . The court returned to being a centre of culture and learning under James VI . He cultivated the image of a philosopher king , evoking the models of David , Solomon and Constantine that were seen in his \" joyous entry \" into Edinburgh in 1579 . The grandest event of his reign was the baptism of his son and heir Prince Henry in 1595 . For this the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle was rebuilt to mirror the proportions of the Temple of Solomon . There were three days of feasting , a staged tournament and a masque featuring a ship of state crewed by classical deities and muses . Masterminded by William Fowler , it was pointedly designed to build the image of the king and support his claim to the English and Irish thrones ."

Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s , and while it produces both bright and light colours , it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows . Oil allows smooth , translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses , from fine lines to thick broad strokes . It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet . These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet @-@ on @-@ wet techniques . Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries . Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light , from shadow to bright beams , and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes . This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures ; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery , wooden floors , textiles and household objects ."

The fruit bodies arise on wood , especially on stumps or around the base of trees , and often in huge numbers . They usually appear between April and July , although most production occurs in the second half of May . Abundant in woodlands , it can invade gardens and orchards , where it can attack many woody plants . The honey fungus infected and killed many plants near tuart trees ( Eucalyptus gomphocephala ) which had been cut down near Kings Park in suburban Perth .

The mushroom has also been reported from southern South America , in Argentina and Chile . A 2003 study of the molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in South America and Australia indicate that A. luteobubalina is an ancient species , originating before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana .

    "text": "Canadian Senator Douglas Roche , O.C. , argues in The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an indirectly elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional checks and balances by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations ' executive branches . It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches . According to Roche , globalization has tended to increase the power of the executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch ; for instance , U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given fast track authority to negotiate trade agreements , subject to a \" yea or nay \" scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal . A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government : \" The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty , ratified by the U.S. Senate , to help achieve economic growth . In April 1998 , a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty , adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones . The United States executive branch agreed to the changes , but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty , even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty . The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval . \" World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30 , however , suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that stand to lose power : \" Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA . They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states ; whatever action the UN takes is a result of bargaining and compromise among member states \" ."

While generally agreeing with the chronicles , they allotted him no importance within their own main field of interest , that of constitutional history . For later generations of historians , the focus shifted from constitutional to personal issues . From the 1970s onwards , the topic of study became the personal relations between magnates and the crown , and the distribution of patronage . It is to this school of thought that Hamilton 's biography belongs , in which he argues that it was Gaveston 's exclusive access to royal patronage that was the driving force behind the baronial animosity towards him . Chaplais , on the other hand , takes a different approach to the study of Gaveston and his place in the reign of Edward II . According to Chaplais , Edward was more or less indifferent to the practice of kingship , and essentially delegated the job to Gaveston . As an alternative to a homosexual relationship , Chaplais suggests that the bond that existed between the King and Gaveston was that of an adoptive brotherhood . This concept had a Biblical precedent in the traditionalist , platonic interpretation of the relationship between David and Jonathan , and also existed in the Middle Ages , as exemplified in The Song of Roland , the story of Roland and Olivier ."

Southern Cross then sailed on to Ross Island , observed the volcano Mount Erebus , and attempted a landing at Cape Crozier , at the foot of Mount Terror . Here , Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a large wave caused by a calving or breakaway of ice from the adjacent Great Ice Barrier . Following the path of James Clark Ross sixty years previously , they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge , to find the inlet where , in 1843 , Ross had reached his farthest south . Observations indicated that the Barrier edge had moved some 30 statute miles ( 50 km ) south since Ross 's time , which meant that the ship were already south of Ross 's record . Borchgrevink was determined to make a landing on the Barrier itself , and in the vicinity of Ross 's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently to suggest that a landing was possible . On 16 February he , Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge , ascended to the Barrier surface , and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78 ° 50 ′ S , a new Farthest South record .

At the same time that Mohaupt was developing hollow @-@ charge ammunition , Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker of the Royal Artillery was investigating the possibility of developing a lightweight platoon mortar . However , rather than using the conventional system of firing the mortar shell from a barrel fixed to a baseplate , Blacker wanted to use the spigot mortar system . Instead of a barrel , there was a steel rod known as a ' spigot ' fixed to a baseplate , and the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail . When the mortar was to be fired , the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot , which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air . By effectively putting the barrel on the inside of the weapon , the barrel diameter was no longer a limitation on the warhead size . Blacker eventually designed a lightweight mortar that he named the ' Arbalest ' and submitted it to the War Office , but it was turned down in favour of a Spanish design . Undeterred , however , Blacker continued with his experiments and decided to try to invent a hand @-@ held anti @-@ tank weapon based on the spigot design , but found that the spigot could not generate sufficient velocity needed to penetrate armour .

    "text": "Banksia grossa is one of five closely related Banksia species that have highly unusual flower nectar . Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery , the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially , but gradually becomes darker and thicker , changing to a thick , olive @-@ green mucilage within one to two days of secretion , and eventually becoming \" an almost black , gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers \" . It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980 ; he attributed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars . Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts , he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen , which is then washed off the flower heads by rain , and absorbed by the proteoid root mat . This purported symbiosis was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985 , but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found . Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar , but is rather \" a chemical phenomenon of plant origin \" . Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free amino acids , but three of these species , including B. sphaerocarpa , have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions . The purpose of coloured nectar is unclear , especially as pollinators such as nocturnal mammals are not thought to forage by sight . However , nectar that becomes more obvious by appearance or smell as it ages might encourage pollinators to prioritise it over newer nectar . It is possible the colour change is unrelated to pollination ."

Idris makes a psychic connection with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room , where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS 's shields without House 's interference . This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift console in the secondary control room , which atomises Nephew .

The only ant known other than Nothomyrmecia which does not exhibit age caste polyethism is Stigmatomma pallipes . Workers are strictly nocturnal , and only emerge from their nests on cold nights . They are most active at temperatures of 5 – 10 ° C ( 41 – 50 ° F ) , and are much more difficult to locate on warmer nights . Workers are possibly most active when it is cold because at these times they encounter fewer and less aggressive competitors , including other more dominant diurnal ant species that are sometimes found foraging during warm nights . Cold temperatures may also hamper the escape of prey items , so increasing the ants ' hunting success . Unless a forager has captured prey , workers stay on trees for the remainder of the night until dawn , possibly relying on sunlight to navigate back to their nest . There is no evidence that they use chemical trails when foraging ; instead , workers rely on visual cues to navigate around . However , chemical markers may play an important role in recognising nest entrances . The ants are solitary foragers . Waste material , such as dead nestmates , cocoon shells , and food remnants , are disposed of far away from the nest ."

Other commentators , however , such as composer Mohammed Fairouz , argued that an attempt at sensitivity in production cannot compensate for \" the inaccurate portrayal of the historic King Mongkut as a childlike tyrant and the infantilization of the entire Siamese population of the court \" , which demonstrate a racist subtext in the piece , even in 1951 when it was written .

For example , the end product ( s ) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors for one of the first enzymes of the pathway ( usually the first irreversible step , called committed step ) , thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways . Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism , because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration . Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according to the demands of the cells . This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy , and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products .

    "text": "Management is based primarily on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs , the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine , and supportive care including the control of agitation , the control of autonomic instability , and the control of hyperthermia . Additionally , those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal if it can be administered within an hour of overdose . The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms . If the symptoms are mild , treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications , offering supportive measures , giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus , and waiting for the symptoms to resolve . Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists . The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy , although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome . Despite the absence of controlled trials , there are a number of case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine . Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists . Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube ; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases . Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine . Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis . People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct @-@ acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine , norepinephrine , or phenylephrine . Conversely , hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short @-@ acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol ; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock . The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment . Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen , so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis , oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin . The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication . In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin . In such instances hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated ."

The King summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout and said \" I order you and all your subjects to be baptised . If you refuse , I 'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel . \" Unsurprisingly , Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke , receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century .

They have short vertebral columns , with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones ( urostyle or coccyx ) . Like other amphibians , oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins . This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air , respiring through their skins . The ribs are poorly developed , so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them . For the skin to serve as a respiratory organ , it must remain moist . This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment , some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream . This may be one of the causes of the worldwide decline in frog populations ."

Before leaving , the Franciscans protested to García and his officers about the poor treatment of the local inhabitants ; the officers promised better treatment of the Maya in future . On 3 August García advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avendaño to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from B 'uk 'te . Avendaño instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions , seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of García 's advance companies and had now retreated into the forest . He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom . He met four exhausted Sajkab 'chen musketeers who were carrying a letter addressed to him from captain Fernández de Estenos . This letter explained that further south there were various deserted Maya towns with only rotten maize abandoned by their occupiers .

In Moscow , the belief was that any trends towards democracy in one bloc country could lead to the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole . Eastern Europe created a fence between Soviet Communism and Western Democracy , and any break in the wall could end Soviet power . The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well . Economically , the Soviet Union was heavily invested in Poland . The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland 's main trading partner . The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured ; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself . The Polish and Soviet economies were thus heavily integrated ; any reform , whether political or economic , in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other . Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically , the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic . The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets for such a long time that breaking away completely would prove disastrous . Thus , both countries held crucial power in different facets . Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically , and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy . Therefore , any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands , while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner ."

Seeing that the ground in front of them was clear of enemy forces , Platov saw an opportunity to go around the French left flank and into the enemy 's rear . He at once sent one of his aides to ask for permission from Kutuzov for such an operation . Platov 's aide was lucky enough to encounter Colonel von Toll , an enterprising member of Kutuzov 's staff , who suggested that General Uvarov 's Ist Cavalry Corps be added to the operation and at once volunteered to present the plan to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Together , they went to see Kutuzov , who nonchalantly gave his permission . There was however no clear plan and no objectives had been drawn up , the whole manoeuvre being interpreted by both Kutuzov and Uvarov as a feint . Uvarov and Platov thus set off , having just around 8000 cavalrymen and 12 guns in total , and no infantry support . As Uvarov moved southwest and south and Platov moved west , they eventually arrived in the undefended rear of Viceroy Eugène 's IV Corps . This was towards midday , just as the Viceroy was getting his orders to conduct another assault on the Raevski redoubt . The sudden appearance of masses of enemy cavalry so close to the supply train and to the Emperor 's Headquarters caused panic and consternation and prompted Eugène to immediately cancel his attack and pull back his entire Corps westwards to deal with this alarming situation . Meanwhile , the two Russian cavalry commanders tried to break what French infantry they could find in the vicinity , but , having no infantry of their own , the poorly coordinated Russian attacks came to nothing . Unable to achieve much else , Platov and Uvarov moved back to their own lines and the action was perceived as a failure by both Kutuzov and the Russian General Staff . As it turned out , however , the action had the utmost importance in the outcome of the battle , as it delayed the attack of the IV Corps on the Raevski redoubt for a critical two hours . During these two hours , the Russians were able to reassess the situation , realize the terrible state of Bagration 's 2nd Army and send reinforcements to the front line . Meanwhile , the retreat of Viceroy Eugène 's Corps had left Montbrun 's II French Cavalry Corps to fill the gap under the most murderous fire , which used and demoralized these cavalrymen , greatly reducing their combat effectiveness . The delay contradicted a military principle the Emperor had stated many times : \" Ground I may recover , time never . \" Also , the Cossacks ' raid contributed to Napoleon 's later decision not to commit his Imperial Guard to battle ."

This damage caused the French ship to swing around wildly , first to port and then suddenly back to starboard into Nymphe , so that the jib boom came to rest between the fore and main masts of the British ship , exerting significant pressure on the mainmast , already weakened by French shot , before the jib boom eventually snapped off . Mullon gave orders for his men to storm Nymphe while the ships were entangled , but his crew refused . As they hesitated , Cléopâtre swung back so that the frigates lay side by side , bow to stern , with Nymphe continuing the heavy cannonade as the British maintopmen worked furiously to disentangle the French rigging from their own ship 's damaged mainmast , Pellew encouraging them with a promise of ten guineas to the man who successfully separated the ships . The British captain had initially been concerned that the collision was a deliberate manoeuvre from Mullon and had readied his men in case the French should launch a boarding attack on his frigate . However , as soon as it became clear that the movement was involuntary and that the French were unwilling to press an attack , Pellew reversed his orders and had the men he had assembled to repel boarders climb on board Cléopâtre instead ."

A typical routine will involve a customer ordering a fish , with their fishmongers in orange rubber overalls and boots calling out the order , which is loudly shouted back by all the other staff , at which point the original fishmonger will throw the customer 's fish behind the counter for wrapping . Initially , the shouted repeating of the ordered fish began as a prank on one employee , but was enjoyed by customers , so it became a tradition . While working , the staff continually yell to each other and chant in unison while they throw ordered fish . At times , the fish market staff will throw a foam fish into the crowd to scare bystanders , or select a customer from the crowds to participate in the fish toss . Above the areas in which they throw fish , the market hangs a sign that reads , \" Caution : Low Flying Fish \" ."

Godfrey was the first bridge engineer for Main Roads , and is credited with introducing concrete and steel bridges into Western Australia ; however , for Clackline Bridge , he proposed using timber – the standard material for the preceding hundred years – with steel construction only for the longer span over the railway . He also suggested that a footpath be included on the bridge , so that schoolchildren and other pedestrians would have a safer railway crossing . The cost was estimated at ₤ 8500 , plus an additional ₤ 700 for the footpath . The initial design was moved 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) south , to satisfy the Railways Department 's requirement that the route not be too close to the Toodyay railway line ( a spur line off the Eastern Railway ) that ran parallel to the highway . This shift increased the curve radius , but required \" the destruction of some well developed pine trees inside the old boundary fence of the [ Clackline School ] playground \" ."

The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem . The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves , producing symptoms of encephalitis , and causes difficulty breathing , speaking and swallowing .

Due to the effect on swallowing , secretions of mucus may build up in the airway , causing suffocation . Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness ( caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve , which innervate the cheeks , tear ducts , gums , and muscles of the face , among other structures ) , double vision , difficulty in chewing , and abnormal respiratory rate , depth , and rhythm ( which may lead to respiratory arrest ) .

Following the Surrender of Japan in August 1945 , nationalist forces loyal to Son Ngoc Thanh launched a coup , which led to Thanh becoming prime minister . When the French returned to Cambodia in October 1945 , Thanh was dismissed and replaced by Sihanouk 's uncle Sisowath Monireth . Monireth negotiated for greater autonomy in managing Cambodia 's internal affairs . A Modus Vivendi was signed in January 1946 whereby Cambodia was granted full autonomy within the French Union . A joint French @-@ Cambodian commission was set up after that to draft Cambodia 's constitution , and in April 1946 , Sihanouk introduced clauses which provided for an elected parliament on the basis of universal male suffrage as well as press freedom .

He cited the sharp incline , which would have made ascension difficult , as well as the lack of water and archaeological evidence on the hill as evidence against it having been the location of Carantouan . Speculation that Spanish Hill was the site of the village was also countered by James Bennett Griffin , who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in 1931 . However , historian Deb Twigg suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth @-@ century archaeologist Warren Moorehead , as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area may have contributed to the lack of artifacts found during the Griffin expedition .

He obtained a reputation as the ' Fighting Bishop ' after playing his part in suppressing the Norfolk rebels during the Peasants ' Revolt , and later embarking on an ill @-@ fated enterprise for Pope Urban VI , who in 1382 employed him to lead a crusade in Flanders against the supporters of the anti @-@ pope Clement VII . For his defeat at the siege of Ypres ( 1383 ) , Despenser was impeached in Parliament , attainted and deprived of his lands . He later regained his lands and favour with king Richard II of England . In 1399 Henry Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire and the military campaign that followed resulted in Richard 's abdication . Despenser remained true to Richard : he was subsequently imprisoned , but was afterwards reconciled with the new king . Henry le Despenser died in his diocese at North Elmham in 1406 ."

The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean . It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology . Florida was once part of the supercontinent Gondwana . Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a basement of igneous granite and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the Paleozoic era 542 to 251 million years ago . During the Cretaceous period ( 145 to 66 million years ago ) , the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by calcium carbonate and formations left by the evaporation of water called evaporites . What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands , shells , and coral , and erosion from water and weather . As ocean water has retreated and progressed , the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times . Waves compressed sands , calcium carbonate , and shells into limestone ; at the ocean 's edge , beach ridges were created by this depositional forming . North @-@ south axis rivers , such as the St. Johns , were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by swales .

It usually then divides a limited number of times and dies , staying within the epithelium where it is unable to migrate to other organs .

Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers , the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny ( somatic mutations ) .

Her capriciousness , fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented : \" She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music \" . Curtiss suggests that Carmen 's character , spiritually and musically , may be a realisation of the composer 's own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage . Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to \" a female Don Giovanni . She would rather die than be false to herself \" . The dramatic personality of the character , and the range of moods she is required to express , call for exceptional acting and singing talents . This has deterred some of opera 's most distinguished exponents ; Maria Callas , though she recorded the part , never performed it on stage . The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that \" French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen \" , though she may have influenced some of Massenet 's heroines . Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire , Richard Strauss 's Salome and Alban Berg 's Lulu \" may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet 's temptress \" ."

This changed with Todd v Gee in 1810 , where Lord Eldon held that \" except in very special cases , it was not the course of proceeding in Equity to file a Bill for specific performance of an agreement ; praying in the alternative , if it cannot be performed , an issue , or an inquiry before the Master , with a view to damages .

I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service . \" As a former jackaroo , he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle : \" I felt horrible about it , being an ex bushy ... at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn 't have to turn butcher . And Heavens , it was butchering too , in every sense of the word . No — not the Japs . Cattle ... If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives , starvation will be our main weapon ... God , I hated doing it but could do nothing else . Felt as sick as hell . \" No action was taken against the \" mutineers \" for their attempted resignations ; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified . In the meantime , Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai . Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant ; the Air Officer Commanding No. 1 TAF , Air Commodore Harry Cobby , himself shortly to be dismissed over the \" mutiny \" , restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective 23 April ."

    "text": "Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts , conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century BC onwards , while greatly extending its power beyond Italy . This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic . Towards the end of this period , in 44 BC , Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated . The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led by Mark Antony and Caesar 's adopted son Octavian . Antony and Octavian 's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian 's forces defeated those of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ( \" first citizen \" ) with proconsular imperium , thus beginning the Principate ( the first epoch of Roman imperial history , usually dated from 27 BC to AD 284 ) , and gave him the name \" Augustus \" ( \" the venerated \" ) . Though the old constitutional machinery remained in place , Augustus came to predominate it . Although the republic stood in name , contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome . Since his rule ended a century of civil wars , and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity , he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure . During the years of his rule , a new constitutional order emerged ( in part organically and in part by design ) , so that , upon his death , this new constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor . The 200 years that began with Augustus 's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana ( \" Roman Peace \" ) . During this period , the cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced . Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent , but put down \" mercilessly and swiftly \" when they occurred . The sixty years of Jewish – Roman wars in the second half of the 1st century and the first half of the 2nd century were exceptional in their duration and violence ."

As part of this , he prefers to be able to see illustrations and game design documents before beginning , as they provide insight into the feel of the game so that his music can mesh in with it .

Edward 's rapprochement towards the earl had in fact started earlier , when on 2 November 1313 , the king pardoned Arundel 's royal debts . The most significant factor in this process though , was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king 's new favourites , the Despensers . Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking over control of the government , and using their power to enrich themselves . While this alienated most of the nobility , Arundel 's situation was different . At some point in 1314 – 1315 , his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel , daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger . Now that he found himself back in royal favour , Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments . In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland , and in August 1318 , he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake , which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster ."

Throughout the outward voyage , Hobbs was severely affected by sea @-@ sickness , a condition which afflicted him on sea voyages throughout his life ; in later tours , he travelled overland as far as possible to reduce his time on ships . Consequently , he missed the first two games of the tour against the Australian state teams . His appearances were further limited by the reluctance of the MCC captain , Arthur Jones , to select him . He played in only two of the early matches , failing on both occasions , and was left out of the team for the first Test match . After England lost the game , Hobbs was chosen for the second Test . Hobbs made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne Cricket Ground . Opening the England batting on the second day , Hobbs scored 83 runs in 182 minutes . Eventually , England needed 282 to win and did so by one wicket ; Hobbs scored 28 . He retained his place for the rest of the series . In the fourth match , he scored 57 on a pitch badly affected by rain ; by adopting a policy of attacking the bowling he hit ten fours . He concluded his series with an innings of 72 in the final game , but could not prevent a third successive English defeat — the home side won the five @-@ match series 4 – 1 . He scored 302 runs in the Tests at an average of 43 @.@ 14 . In other first @-@ class matches , he scored centuries against Tasmania and Victoria , totalling 876 runs at 41 @.@ 71 ."

In the kidneys , aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions . Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2 % of filtered sodium in the kidneys , which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates . Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation . Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production . The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume , which in turn influences blood pressure .

On 16 March , the system was designated Tropical Cyclone 18S by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center , with winds of 30 km / h ( 20 mph ) . The system then crossed Melville and Bathurst Islands and moved into the Timor Sea , where it intensified , and was given the name Fay by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology . Fay began to turn southward on 17 March ; simultaneously , the cyclone continued to intensify due to a weakening of vertical wind shear , and well @-@ defined outflow became apparent on satellite imagery . The following day , a steering ridge to the south of the system strengthened and pushed the cyclone away from the coast and to the northwest . At the same time , the system continued to intensify due to the favourable environment in the upper atmosphere . However , hot , dry air flowing into the system from the south , combined with vertical wind sheer , kept the storm from strengthening as much at its maximum potential rate ."
