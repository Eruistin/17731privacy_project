The earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was Ma Jianzhong 's 1898 Ma 's Basic Principles for Writing Clearly ( 马氏文通 ) . From then until the 1940s , linguists such as Ma , Wang Li , and Li Jinxi treated classifiers as just a type of noun that \" expresses a quantity \" . Lü Shuxiang was the first to treat them as a separate category , calling them \" unit words \" ( 单位词 dānwèicí ) in his 1940s Outline of Chinese Grammar ( 中国文法要略 ) and finally \" measure words \" ( 量词 liàngcí ) in Grammar Studies ( 语法学习 ) . He made this separation based on the fact that classifiers were semantically bleached , and that they can be used directly with a number , whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number . After this time , other names were also proposed for classifiers : Gao Mingkai called them \" noun helper words \" ( 助名词 zhùmíngcí ) , Lu Wangdao \" counting markers \" ( 计标 jìbiāo ) , and Japanese linguist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them \" accompanying words \" ( 陪伴词 péibàncí ) . In the Draft Plan for a System of Teaching Chinese Grammar ( 暂拟汉语教学语法系统 ) adopted by the People 's Republic of China in 1954 , Lü 's \" measure words \" ( 量词 liàngcí ) was adopted as the official name for classifiers in China . This remains the most common term in use today ."

    "text": "Tidal heating occurs through the tidal friction processes : orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the crust of an object . In addition , to the extent that tides produce heat along fractures , libration may affect the magnitude and distribution of such tidal shear heating . Tidal dissipation of Enceladus 's ice crust is significant because Enceladus has a subsurface ocean . Scientific models of heating on Enceladus suggest that despite the increased heat from tidal dissipation , the total observed heating of Enceladus is not enough to maintain a subsurface ocean for more than 30 million years ( Enceladus is billions of years old ) , even if the ocean contains other chemical components that lower its freezing point . It is thought that if Enceladus had a more eccentric orbit in the past , the enhanced tidal forces could be sufficient to maintain a subsurface ocean , such that a periodic enhancement in eccentricity could maintain a subsurface ocean that periodically changes in size . Previous models suggest that resonant perturbations of Dione could provide the necessary periodic eccentricity changes to maintain the subsurface ocean of Enceladus , if the ocean contains a substantial amount of ammonia . The surface of Enceladus indicates that the entire moon has experienced periods of enhanced heat flux in the past ."

He promptly arrested several thousand opposition leaders , branding them communists , repealed the constitution of 1945 , and granted himself virtually unbridled power . Concentration camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails overflowed . Acting on the advice of Dulles , Castillo Armas also detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country . He also created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism , with sweeping powers of arrest , detention , and deportation . Over the next few years , the committee investigated nearly 70 @,@ 000 people . Many were imprisoned , executed , or \" disappeared \" , frequently without trial . He outlawed all political parties , labor unions , and peasant organizations . Castillo Armas ' dependence on the officer corps and the merceneries who had put him in power led to widespread corruption , and the Eisenhower administration was soon subsidizing the Guatemalan government with many millions of U.S. dollars . Castillo Armas also reversed the agrarian reforms of Árbenz , leading the U.S. embassy to comment that it was a \" long step backwards \" from the previous policy . The United Fruit Company also did not profit from the coup ; despite regaining most of its privileges , its profits continued to decline , and it was eventually merged with another company to save itself from bankruptcy . Despite the influence which some of the local Catholic Church leaders had in the coup , anti @-@ Catholic restrictions which had been enforced under previous governments in Guatemala would resume by the 1960s , as many anti @-@ communist governments felt the Church had too much sympathy towards socialist parties ."

    "text": "By the fifteenth century , beginning in northern Italy , universities had become strongly influenced by humanist thinking . This put an emphasis on classical authors , questioning some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifesting itself in the teaching of new subjects , particularly through the medium of the Greek language . However , in this period , Scottish universities largely had a Latin curriculum , designed for the clergy , civil and common lawyers . They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new humanist scholarship , focusing on metaphysics and putting a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle , whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance . Towards the end of the fifteenth century , a humanist influence was becoming more evident . A major figure was Archibald Whitelaw , a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493 . By 1497 , the humanist and historian Hector Boece , born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris , returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen . In 1518 Mair returned to Scotland to become Principal of the University of Glasgow . He transferred to St. Andrews in 1523 and in 1533 he was made Provost of St Salvator 's College . While in Scotland his students included John Knox and George Buchanan . These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century ."

The book was a tale of romance , intrigue and double identity , and was considered a bit of a sensation at the time of its publication . Du Maurier apparently believed that the painting referred to the novel . The review in the Athenaeum complained that painting did not correspond to the character in the novel , propmpting Whistler to write a letter asserting that the gallery chose the title without consulting him , adding \" I had no intention whatsoever of illustrating Mr Wilkie Collins ' novel . My painting simply represents a girl dressed in white standing in front of a white curtain . \""

The species has a low genetic diversity but does not seem to suffer the same lack of vitality that afflicts other such species of rock iguana . One theory is that the species evolved from a single female Cuban iguana ( C. nubila nubila ) with eggs inside her who drifted across the sea , perhaps during a storm . It is distinct from the subspecies found on Little Cayman and Cayman Brac known as C. nubila caymanensis , although it can breed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring ."

Heavy water was extremely scarce and difficult to produce , and Germany only possessed a small amount which had been produced in laboratories . Norway possessed a large amount which was produced by the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant near the village of Rjukan , but the Norwegian government would not sell more than three gallons of heavy water a month , becoming suspicious of the sudden increase in demand for the water by the German government . When Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany in April 1940 , however , this obstruction ended ; the Vemork plant was captured and began producing heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme . Production of heavy water was slowed initially due to the effects of the fighting in Norway and a drought in the area , which led to a lack of water to provide hydroelectric power for the plant . However , once the weather improved and snow began to melt , providing enough water to create sufficient hydroelectric power , production continued ."

    "text": "Ceawlin is the second king in Bede 's list . All the subsequent bretwaldas followed more or less consecutively , but there is a long gap , perhaps fifty years , between Ælle of Sussex , the first bretwalda , and Ceawlin . The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin 's dates matching the later entries in the Chronicle with reasonable accuracy . According to this analysis , the next bretwalda , Æthelberht of Kent , must have been already a dominant king by the time Pope Gregory the Great wrote to him in 601 , since Gregory would have not written to an underking . Ceawlin defeated Æthelberht in 568 according to the Chronicle . Æthelberht 's dates are a matter of debate , but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580 . The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin 's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years . If this battle is placed near the year 590 , before Æthelberht has established himself as a powerful king , then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin 's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date . In any case , the battle with Æthelberht is unlikely to have been more than a few years on either side of 590 . The gap between Ælle and Ceawlin , on the other hand , has been taken as supporting evidence for the story told by Gildas in De Excidio of a peace lasting a generation or more following a Briton victory at Mons Badonicus ."

    "text": "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ( \" little tentacles \" ) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it . Colloblasts are specialized mushroom @-@ shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . The function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart . In addition to colloblasts , members of the genus Haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria @-@ eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense . The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . Euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ( in 40 to 60 milliseconds ) ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey . The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle . The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type . Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle ."

The challenge asserted foremost that the 1949 Act was delegated rather than primary legislation , and that the 1911 Act had delegated power to the Commons . If this were the case , then the Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Act without direct permission from the Lords . Since it was passed under the 1911 Act , it had never received the required consent of the Lords . However , the 1949 Act was found to be legal . The 1911 Act , it was concluded , was not primarily about empowering the Commons , but rather to restrict the ability of the Lords to affect legislation . This ruling also means that efforts to abolish the House of Lords ( a major constitutional change ) using the Act could be successful , although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling ."

Louis 's wife Constance died and Louis married Adèle , the sister of the Counts of Blois and Champagne . Louis also betrothed his two daughters Marie and Alix to Theobald of Blois 's sons , Theobald and Henry . This represented an aggressive containment strategy towards Henry rather than the agreed rapprochement , and caused Theobald to abandon his alliance with Henry .

Exposure of soil caused by trampling and vegetation removal via grazing , combined with increased nutrients being recycled by horse dung , favour weed species , which then invade the region and overtake native species , diminishing their diversity . The dispersal of weeds is aided by the attachment of seeds to the horses ’ manes and tails , and are also transferred via horse dung after consumption of weeds in one location and excrement in another . Although the effects of the weeds that actually germinate after transfer via dung is debated , the fact that a large number of weed species are dispersed via this method is of concern to those interested in the survival of native plant species in Australia . The effect on plants and plant habitats are more pronounced during droughts , when horses travel greater distances to find food and water . They consume the already threatened and limited vegetation , and their negative influences are more widespread .

The twenty nine Dakotas that were to transport the battalion would take off from Maison Blanche and follow the coast until they reached the harbour at Bône . The leading Dakota would then turn south east and fly low over the airfield to ascertain its status . If it was unoccupied the paratroopers would be dropped onto the airfield , but if the Fallschirmjaeger were present then the Dakotas would drop the companies a mile away ; there they would form up and launch an attack on the airfield . The planning was completed by 16 : 30 , and at 20 : 00 the American pilots were briefed on the operation , which was briefly interrupted when a German aircraft flew over the area and dropped a stick of bombs . The aircraft took off at 08 : 30 the next day and experienced an uneventful flight to the airfield , although two aircraft experienced mechanical problems and ditched into the ocean , causing three casualties . The lead Dakota flew over the airfield , and after observing the airfield to be unoccupied , dropped its paratroopers , followed in succession by the remaining transport aircraft . The drop was reasonably accurate , with a few containers and paratroopers being dropped three miles from the airfield . Thirteen men were injured during the drop , primarily when they landed , and one was killed when he accidentally shot himself with his Sten gun . One officer was knocked unconscious during landing and remained so for the next four days , on occasion being heard to murmur \" I 'll have a little more of the turbot , waiter ! \" . Unknown to the British force , their drop had been observed by a flight of German Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft , carrying the battalion of Fallschirmjaegers ; having seen that the airfield was already occupied , the aircraft turned back towards Tunis . When it had secured the airfield , the battalion came under attack from Stuka divebombers , and was initially defenceless . However , once No.6 Commando had secured Bône a number of Oerlikon anti aircraft guns were salvaged from sunken vessels in the port 's harbour and these , in combination with a squadron of Spitfires that arrived on the evening of 11 November , were used to fend off future attacks . The battalion held the airfield in conjunction with No.6 Commando until 15 November , when it withdrew and linked up with ' A ' Company and the rest of 1st Parachute Brigade at Maison Blanche ."

The platforms – Android , iOS and PlayStation Vita – were decided on from the beginning . Initially , there were some arguments at Square Enix about whether to create the game using 2D or 3D graphics ; they settled on 3D , as Oyamada thought that 3D games are easier to control on smartphones . Additionally , the development team thought that a 3D version would be better , as it could be used as a base for potential remakes of other Mana games ; depending on the reception of Adventures of Mana , Oyamada said that he would like to develop a remake of Seiken Densetsu 3 , and would consider one of Secret of Mana depending on demand ."

The victor , William II Rufus , granted the city to a royal physician , John of Tours , who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath . Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey 's grounds from the king , as well as the city of Bath itself . Whether John paid Rufus for the city or whether he was given it as a gift by the king is unclear . The abbey had recently lost its abbot , Ælfsige , and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city ; it was likely the abbey 's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery . By acquiring Bath , John also acquired the mint that was in the city . In 1090 he transferred the seat , or administration , of the bishopric to Bath Abbey , probably in an attempt to increase the revenues of his see . Bath was a rich abbey , and Wells had always been a poor diocese . By taking over the abbey , John increased his episcopal revenues . William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey , but it was part of a pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns . When John moved his episcopal seat , he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter , turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons at Wells who had previously served the diocese . John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath , which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray 's rebellions . Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells – a comparatively small settlement – to the then walled city of Bath ."

The fruit bodies are medium @-@ sized , pure white , and when wet are covered in a layer of slime thick enough to make the mushroom difficult to pick up . The gills are broadly attached to the stem or running down it ; as the family name suggests , they feel waxy when rubbed between the fingers .

They are common in a variety of forest types , where they grow on the ground in thickets or grassy areas . Hygrophorus eburneus is the type species of the genus Hygrophorus . A number of biologically active chemicals have been purified from the fruit bodies of the fungus , including fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity ."

However , cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon . As a result , this time of day is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels . Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic levels of the day at noon and in the early afternoon , owing to the sun 's high angle in the sky . The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny , harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels , since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening ."

It was also the language of the economic and social elite , even in Flanders . By the 1860s , with Flemish dialects in decline , increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual , paralleling a similar decline in northern France . However , partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture , the Flamingant political movement began to develop , with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s . Political agitation by Flamingant groups , often directed by local priests , led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870 . Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory , reinforcing the language 's presence . By 1898 , Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters . During the first decades of the 20th century , the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement ( although not a united one ) , fully emerging during the First World War ."

To prevent the bill from dying in committee , Mansfield proposed a motion to require the Judiciary Committee to report the bill out of committee by April 9 , which the Senate overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 67 to 13 . During the committee 's consideration of the bill , Senator Ted Kennedy ( D @-@ MA ) led an effort to amend the bill to prohibit poll taxes . Although the Twenty @-@ fourth Amendment — which banned the use of poll taxes in federal elections — was ratified a year earlier , Johnson 's administration and the bill 's sponsors did not include a provision in the voting rights bill banning poll taxes in state elections because they feared courts would strike down the legislation as unconstitutional . Additionally , by excluding poll taxes from the definition of \" tests or devices \" , the coverage formula did not reach Texas or Arkansas , mitigating opposition from those two states ' influential congressional delegations . Nonetheless , with the support of liberal committee members , Kennedy 's amendment to prohibit poll taxes passed by a 9 @-@ 4 vote . In response , Dirksen offered an amendment that exempted from the coverage formula any state that had at least 60 % of its eligible residents registered to vote or that had a voter turnout that surpassed the national average in the preceding presidential election . This amendment , which effectively exempted all states from coverage except Mississippi , passed during a committee meeting in which three liberal members were absent . Dirksen offered to drop the amendment if the poll tax ban were removed . Ultimately , the bill was reported out of committee on April 9 by a 12 @-@ 4 vote without a recommendation ."

During that period , writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of superheroes that he could revamp , as he had done in his Miracleman series in the early 1980s . Moore reasoned that MLJ Comics ' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project , so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour . The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used , as long as readers recognized them \" so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was \" . Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who Killed the Peacemaker , and submitted the unsolicited proposal to DC managing editor Dick Giordano . Giordano was receptive to the proposal , but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story . Moore said , \" DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional . \" Instead , Giordano persuaded Moore to continue with new characters . Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers , but later changed his mind . He said , \" Eventually , I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough , so that they seemed familiar in certain ways , certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super @-@ hero resonance or familiarity to the reader , then it might work . \""

One night bassist Noel Redding was warned about a pending visit from law enforcement , so he immediately phoned drummer Mitch Mitchell , who was at the nightclub Whisky a Go Go , and asked him to come over to the house so that they could search for and remove any illegal drugs . They found a large assortment of substances in Hendrix 's room that had apparently been given to him by fans . Soon afterwards , they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house ."

It appeared on bootleg albums before finally being released in 2003 on BBC Sessions . On March 10 , 1968 , Cream recorded it again during a concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco . According to two music writers , the recording was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for the trio – in the notes for Clapton 's Crossroads box set , Anthony DeCurtis credits the trimming to engineer Tom Dowd , while critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the editing to producer Felix Pappalardi , who \" cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes \" , to allow the song 's drive more continuity.However , Clapton biographer Schumacher does not mentioning editing and adds \" Given the passion of the solo performances on ' Crossroads , ' it seems almost miraculous that Cream is able to return to the song itself . \" \" Crossroads \" became the opening number on the live half of Cream 's Wheels of Fire double album , released in August 1968 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US .

In McDonald 's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue , and there is only one traditional aria . The result is that \" such stylistic economy – more sophisticated , more challenging than he had employed before – is the keynote of the work . \" McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously , Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century : \" the lyricism is abbreviated , glanced at rather than indulged . Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish , replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea \" . In McDonald 's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action . It has influenced at least one of Verdi 's operatic successors : in 1952 Imogen Holst , musical assistant to Benjamin Britten , wrote , after a performance of Falstaff , \" I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [ Verdi ] .

Author Rikky Rooksby wrote in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , that the song was appropriate for the film and its nostalgic moment towards the end , showing the characters grown up and reuniting at a museum opened for themselves and the titular league . He called it \" one of Madonna 's very best recordings and most expressive single \" . While reviewing Something to Remember , author Chris Wade wrote in his book The Music of Madonna , that the song conjured up a \" strangely sad , nostalgic feel , reminding ourselves of memories from yesteryear \" . He commended Madonna 's vocals calling it as the song 's \" premier sound \" and adding that the way \" she sings and captures the melancholic melody is heartbreaking [ ... ] it 's one of her finest ever ballads . \" Encyclopedia Madonnica writer and journalist Matthew Rettenmund noted in the book that the song 's rise to the top of the charts was aided by its \" honest delivery and aching sense of loneliness , regret and nostalgia for friendship lost . \""

Under Louis XV and XVI , the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds , and to support the operations of the Parisian police , especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media . Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions , criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century , fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners . Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced . In 1789 the royal government 's financial crisis and the formation of the National Assembly gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city @-@ dwellers . On 14 July the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd , primarily residents of the faubourg Saint @-@ Antoine who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress . Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille 's governor , Bernard @-@ René de Launay , was killed by the crowd . The Bastille was demolished by order of the Committee of the Hôtel de Ville . Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of despotism . Over the next century , the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French revolutions , political protests and popular fiction , and it remained an important symbol for the French Republican movement ."

Cisneros allowed free trade as well , as instructed by the Junta of Seville , which benefited British merchants ; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War . The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy , moral values , social usages , religious practices , and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy . As a result , Cisneros closed trade again , restoring the Spanish monopsony . A group of hacendados ( owners of haciendas ) , who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo , asked Moreno to defend them . Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners , a report that represented the export interest of the landowners , encouraged free trade , and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony . It is considered the most comprehensive economic report from the time of the viceroyalty . It represented the new European economic ideas , and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled . Several authors have questioned Moreno 's authorship of the paper , considering it instead an update of another , previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano , Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires , written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers . This report , as well as Moreno 's prestige in the colonial society , helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros . Yet secretly , Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy ."

Several studies from that period refuted Whorf 's hypothesis , demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles . Many studies were highly critical and disparaging in their language , ridiculing Whorf 's analyses and examples or his lack of an academic degree . Throughout the 1980s most mentions of Whorf or of the Sapir @-@ Whorf hypotheses continued to be disparaging , and led to a widespread view that Whorf 's ideas had been proven wrong . Because Whorf was treated so severely in the scholarship during those decades , he has been described as \" one of the prime whipping boys of introductory texts to linguistics \" . In the late 1980s , with the advent of cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics some linguists sought to rehabilitate Whorf 's reputation , as scholarship began to question whether earlier critiques of Whorf were justified ."

    "text": "The Singapore strategy was the cornerstone of British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s . By 1937 , according to Captain Stephen Roskill , \" the concept of the ' Main Fleet to Singapore ' had , perhaps through constant repetition , assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ \" . A combination of financial , political and practical difficulties ensured that it could not be successfully implemented . During the 1930s , the strategy came under sustained criticism in Britain and abroad , particularly in Australia , where the Singapore strategy was used as an excuse for parsimonious defence policies . The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of Force Z to Singapore and the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941 . The subsequent ignominious fall of Singapore was described by Winston Churchill as \" the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history \" ."

All the flowers of a herb appear at one time , except for basil which puts out a series of flowers starting low on the plant . Cumin has the most fruits , but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop . Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs , for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest , while there are many kinds of onion , with Sardian , Cnidian , Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions . Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice ; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads . All herbs except rue are said to like dung . Of the wild herbs , Theophrastus reports that some such as cat 's ear are edible , whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating ."

However , the evidence suggests that the DMH 's assumptions are shaky , because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of synergy between harmful mutations .

Although there are anonymous , documented songs from Naples from many centuries ago , the term , canzone Napoletana now generally refers to a large body of relatively recent , composed popular music — such songs as \" ' O sole mio \" , \" Torna a Surriento \" , and \" Funiculi Funicula \" . In the 18th century , many composers , including Alessandro Scarlatti , Leonardo Vinci , and Giovanni Paisiello , contributed to the Neapolitan tradition by using the local language for the texts of some of their comic operas . Later , others — most famously Gaetano Donizetti — composed Neapolitan songs that garnered great renown in Italy and abroad . The Neapolitan song tradition became formalized in the 1830s through an annual songwriting competition for the yearly Piedigrotta festival , dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta , a well @-@ known church in the Mergellina area of Naples . The music is identified with Naples , but is famous abroad , having been exported on the great waves of emigration from Naples and southern Italy roughly between 1880 and 1920 . Language is an extremely important element of Neapolitan song , which is always written and performed in Neapolitan , the regional minority language of Campania . Neapolitan songs typically use simple harmonies , and are structured in two sections , a refrain and narrative verses , often in contrasting relative or parallel major and minor keys . In non @-@ musical terms , this means that many Neapolitan songs can sound joyful one minute and melancholy the next ."

During the 1950s , as the process continued to gain popularity , some users turned to carbon dioxide as an alternative to the more expensive welding atmospheres consisting of argon and helium , but this proved unacceptable for welding aluminum and magnesium because it reduced weld quality , so it is rarely used with GTAW today . The use of any shielding gas containing an oxygen compound , such as carbon dioxide , quickly contaminates the tungsten electrode , making it unsuitable for the TIG process . In 1953 , a new process based on GTAW was developed , called plasma arc welding .

After his participation in the Ottoman loss at the Battle of Niš , Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army and rushed to Albania alongside 300 other Albanians . By forging a letter from Murad II to the Governor of Krujë , he became lord of the city in November 1443 . Hungarian captain John Hunyadi 's continued operations against Sultan Murad II gave Skanderbeg time to prepare an alliance of the Albanian nobles . Skanderbeg invited all of Albania 's nobles to meet in the Venetian @-@ held town of Alessio ( Lezhë ) on 2 March 1444 . Alessio was chosen as the meeting point because the town had once been the capital of the Dukagjini family and to induce Venice to lend aid to the Albanian movement . Among the nobles that attended were George Arianiti , Paul Dukagjini , Andrea Thopia , Lekë Dushmani , Teodor Korona , Peter Spani , Lekë Zaharia , and Paul Stres Balsha . Here they formed the League of Lezhë , a confederation of all of the major Albanian princes in alliance against the Ottoman Empire . The chosen captain ( Albanian : Kryekapedan ) of this confederation was Skanderbeg . The League 's first military challenge came in the spring of 1444 , when Skanderbeg 's scouts reported that the Ottoman army was planning to invade Albania . Skanderbeg planned to move towards the anticipated entry point and prepared for an engagement ."

This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised , as there is no valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder . This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder , and isolated from the internal pressure independently , which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders ."

Native Americans used a route made up of a series of shallow oyster beds , dubbed Reef Road . The passage , which was about 18 to 24 inches in depth , could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into Corpus Christi Bay . White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s , and it became a common way to pass from Portland to Corpus Christi via buggy , although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall off the beds and drown . A wooden causeway connecting Portland and Corpus Christi was first constructed in 1915 , but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms . A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s , and a double lane was added in 1988 . The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway ."

Clouzot found it easy to imagine the setting of the script and was very anxious to film Arnaud 's story . He started writing the film , The Wages of Fear , with his brother , Jean Clouzot , who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme Geronimi . Production on The Wages of Fear lasted from 1951 to 1952 . In order to gain as much independence as possible , Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films , which he named after his wife . The sole female role in The Wages of Fear is played by Véra . Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife , as the character does not exist in the original novel . The Wages of Fear is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire . The Wages of Fear was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7 million spectators . It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor ( for Charles Vanel ) at the Cannes Film Festival . Clouzot 's next big hit was Diabolique , whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock . Diabolique involves the story of a cruel headmaster who brutalizes his wife and his mistress . The two women murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool , but when the pool is drained , no corpse is found . In 1954 , Diabolique won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film . In this early and mid @-@ 1950s period , with the films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique , Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences .

The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works , all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film 's production . Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances , having met when Clouzot was 14 .

For ten minutes , the masts and rigging of Mars came under fire , with damage to the bowsprit and foremast , as Hood continued to attempt to hold his firing position against the current before pulling slightly ahead of Hercule at 21 : 25 and dropping anchor . The port bow anchor became entangled with the starboard anchor on Hercule and the British ship was swung violently into the French ship , the force of the collision unhinging four of the gunports on Mars ."

Some scholars have argued that the conflict between spiritual and scientific inclinations have been a driving force in Whorf 's intellectual development , particularly in the attraction by ideas of linguistic relativity . Some of Whorf 's unpublished manuscripts on spirituality also suggest that he was influenced by the ideas of Helena Blavatsky the founder of the Theosophical Society who wrote about cosmic evolution , a belief that regards reincarnation to be the source of evolution of human races towards continuously higher forms . Whorf said that \" of all groups of people with whom I have come in contact , Theosophical people seem the most capable of becoming excited about ideas — new ideas . \""

The viceroy has subspecies with somewhat different coloration , each closely matching the local Danaus species . For example , in Florida , the pairing is of the viceroy and the queen butterfly , whereas in Mexico the viceroy resembles the soldier butterfly . The viceroy is thus involved in three different Müllerian pairs . This example was long believed to be Batesian , with the viceroy mimicking the monarch , but the viceroy is actually the more unpalatable species . The genus Morpho is palatable , but some species ( such as M. amathonte ) are strong fliers ; birds – even species that specialize in catching butterflies on the wing – find it hard to catch them . The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most Morpho species may be Müllerian , or may be \" pursuit aposematism \" . The \" orange complex \" of distasteful butterfly species includes the heliconiines Agraulis vanillae , Dryadula phaetusa , and Dryas iulia .

    "text": "The German or , more generally , European overtones give the story a medieval setting , though the time and place of the plot is left indistinct . The atmosphere of the story combines both realistic and supernatural worlds while depicting pathological emotional states , likely influenced by the works of Ludwig Tieck and E. T. A. Hoffmann . It has been called a precursor to \" The Fall of the House of Usher \" and other later works . Among the elements Poe first uses in \" Metzengerstein \" which will become typical in his later works are the decaying and gloomy building with oddly shaped rooms , the remote , secluded property , vivid colors , and underground vaults as well as themes of vengeance and the overwhelming power of evil . Future works will also depict characters of extreme wealth ; besides Metzengerstein , other examples are Roderick Usher , the narrator in \" Ligeia \" and Legrand 's restored fortune in \" The Gold @-@ Bug \" . Poe also uses teeth as a symbol for the first time in \" Metzengerstein \" . The horse 's teeth are described as \" sepulchral and disgusting \" . Poe would later use teeth as a sign of mortality , as in lips writhing about the teeth of the mesmerized man in \" The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar \" , the sound of grating teeth in \" Hop @-@ Frog \" , and the obsession over teeth in \" Berenice \" . Death by fire would later be reused in Poe 's story \" Hop @-@ Frog \" as another punishment . Though Poe was emulating popular horror fiction of the time , \" Metzengerstein \" shows what made Poe 's horror tales stand out : rather than focusing on blood and gore , he explored the minds of the characters to better understand them ."

As a result , Shackleton opted to aim for the western side of South Georgia which meant , given the prevailing winds , that if they missed their target they would be carried onto the east coast of the island . The following day , they began to observe drifting seaweed and seabirds circulating overhead , indicating the presence of land ahead . On 8 May , through mists and squalls , the crew sighted South Georgia 's Cape Demidov , precisely in line with the course calculated by Worsley . He saw a \" ... towering black crag , with a lacework of snow around its flanks . One glimpse , and it was hidden again .

Now out of drinking water , they were forced by the high seas to approach the rocky coast with care and heave to for the night .

Conditions were much better on 10 May and after adverse winds caused failure of his first few attempts , Worsley carefully sailed the James Caird through a rocky reef guarding King Haakon Bay and onto the beach ."

    "text": "Partial agonists are defined as drugs that , at a given receptor , might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy . Although they are agonists , partial agonists can act as a competitive antagonist in the presence of a full agonist , as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy , thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone . Clinically , their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity . Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant , weak level of activity , whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels . In addition , it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists . Buprenorphine , a partial agonist of the μ @-@ opioid receptor , binds with weak morphine @-@ like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence ."

Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict , so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches , but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often took a few months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength . A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action . When the KRRC 's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives , they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men shouted as they went over the top . Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench ; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele ( two African languages ) instead of English ."

With more severe trauma , there is a greater amount of edema , bleeding , and tearing of the alveoli . Pulmonary contusion is characterized by microhemorrhages ( tiny bleeds ) that occur when the alveoli are traumatically separated from airway structures and blood vessels . Blood initially collects in the interstitial space , and then edema occurs by an hour or two after injury . An area of bleeding in the contused lung is commonly surrounded by an area of edema . In normal gas exchange , carbon dioxide diffuses across the endothelium of the capillaries , the interstitial space , and across the alveolar epithelium ; oxygen diffuses in the other direction . Fluid accumulation interferes with gas exchange , and can cause the alveoli to fill with proteins and collapse due to edema and bleeding .

Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility , citing as an example a moment in the story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language : \" You must be sure and make it convincing how they did it ; for they have absolutely no method of approach to a written language of another world . \" On one occasion Lasser 's work with his authors extended to collaboration : \" The Time Projector \" , a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Wonder Stories , was credited to David H.

    "text": "In 1950 , with New Worlds on a stable quarterly schedule , Nova Publications decided to launch a companion , Science Fantasy . They chose Walter Gillings as the editor ; but he was replaced by Carnell after two issues , partly because Nova could not afford to pay two editorial salaries , and partly because of \" fundamental differences of opinion \" . At the end of 1951 New Worlds went bimonthly , and by the middle of the year had reached a circulation of 18 @,@ 000 . The price had been reduced to 1 / 6 with the third issue , but with paper costs rising Nova looked for a cheaper printer . The new printer , The Carlton Press , was supposed to take over production with the May 1953 issue ( number 21 ) , but the issue was late , and had to be dated June 1953 instead . The issue was shoddily produced , which dismayed Nova 's board , and printers ' strikes caused further delays . Nova discovered that The Carlton Press was an agent with no printing facilities ; they farmed out work to other printers , but were only able to get their commissions executed when they paid off any prior debts to those printers . Issue 22 was repeatedly delayed ; proofs appeared in August , and the issue itself was promised for November . Even this late schedule was not adhered to , and Carnell finally received a copy of the print run in January 1954 . The copy was dated 1953 ( with no month ) , and since this made it useless for distribution in 1954 , Carnell refused to accept the print run . While the dispute with the printers was going on , Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith , a journalist acquaintance of Carnell 's , put together a small conference of well @-@ known science fiction authors , including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham . Goldsmith covered the conference for Illustrated , a weekly magazine , and the article caught the attention of Maclaren & Sons Ltd , a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine . Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications , but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova , with a commitment to produce New Worlds on a monthly basis and Science Fantasy on a bimonthly schedule . By January 1954 , when The Carlton Press delivered the incorrectly dated issue 22 , the acquisition by Maclaren was complete , and Maclaren 's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute . The printing press who had actually printed the issue were not paid by The Carlton Press , so an injunction was obtained that sequestered the issues to avoid them being sold to recover the printing costs . Carnell retained the copy he had been sent in January , and it is thought that this is the only copy that exists of The Carlton Press 's version of this issue , as the remainder of the printing run was destroyed at the conclusion of the court case . The cover painting , by Gerard Quinn , was subsequently used on issue 13 of Science Fantasy , and all the stories and editorial material eventually appeared in later issues of New Worlds over the next year ."

Their idea was to create a strong female protagonist who was adept at combat and less feminine than previous Final Fantasy heroines . Aspects of her early design and personality were later altered , or transferred to other characters . After XIII , Lightning 's design was revised several times to reflect her role and development in each game , particularly in Lightning Returns . Her name in Japanese , Éclair Farron ( エクレール ・ ファロン , Ekurēru Faron ) , was originally a placeholder . Because of its similarity to the name of a pastry , her first name was changed to \" Claire \" in other countries ."

The specific policy varied from territory to territory , but in general , there was no Polish @-@ language education at all . German policy constituted a crash @-@ Germanization of the populace . Polish teachers were dismissed , and some were invited to attend \" orientation \" meetings with the new administration , where they were either summarily arrested or executed on the spot . Some Polish schoolchildren were sent to German schools , while others were sent to special schools where they spent most of their time as unpaid laborers , usually on German @-@ run farms ; speaking Polish brought severe punishment . It was expected that Polish children would begin to work once they finished their primary education at age 12 to 15 . In the eastern territories not included in the General Government ( Bezirk Bialystok , Reichskommissariat Ostland and Reichskommissariat Ukraine ) many primary schools were closed , and most education was conducted in non @-@ Polish languages such as Ukrainian , Belorussian , and Lithuanian . In the Bezirk Bialystok region , for example , 86 % of the schools that had existed before the war were closed down during the first two years of German occupation , and by the end of the following year that figure had increased to 93 % ."

Louisa escaped from the asylum in January 1848 , travelling across London to meet the Reverend William Cobbe from The Agapemone at a hotel in Cavendish Square , but was recaptured two days later at Paddington railway station .

While whatever GF ( s ) are junctioned to a character , determines what stats can be enhanced and what commands and abilities can be set , what kind of enhancement is made to each stat available depends on what magic spells are junctioned to it , that the character has acquired .

In a 1968 lecture at Harvard University , Borges praised Tennyson 's translation , stating that in some locutions Tennyson sounds \" more Saxon than the original . \" A translation by Burton Raffel is included in Alexandra Hennessey Olsen 's anthology Poems and prose from the Old English ."

The mutineers surrendered after four days , when a bill was passed granting amnesty to all those involved . In 1922 , the two battleships were used to help put down a revolt at Fort Copacabana . Two years later , lieutenants on São Paulo mutinied but found little support from other military units , so they sailed to Montevideo , Uruguay , and obtained asylum . Minas Geraes was modernized in the 1930s , but both battleships were too old to participate actively in the Second World War , and instead were employed as harbor defense ships in Salvador and Recife . São Paulo was sold in 1951 to a British shipbreaker , but was lost in a storm north of the Azores while being towed to its final destination . Minas Geraes was sold to an Italian scrapper in 1953 and towed to Genoa the following year ."

In 1929 , Reid predicted that Alberta was on the cusp of a period of economic expansion ; instead , he was soon confronted with the Great Depression . He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes , in part by creating a new income tax . He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending . His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised . Conversely , he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure ."

He stood for election to the United States House of Representatives in the 1789 election ( the first after the adoption of the United States Constitution ) but was defeated by Jonathan Grout . After the death of the immensely popular Governor John Hancock in 1793 , the state 's gubernatorial election of 1794 was a wide open race . Gill was one of several nominees for lieutenant governor , and received more votes than all nominees except the winning gubernatorial candidate , Samuel Adams . With no candidates for lieutenant governor receiving a majority , the General Court decided the election , choosing Gill . He thereafter won annual reelection to that post . In 1796 the aging Adams announced he would not run for reelection the following spring , and again the election was a wide open affair . The party system was still taking shape in the state , and the Federalists nominated Increase Sumner , while more populist factions that had previously supported Hancock and Adams nominated Gill and James Sullivan . Although Gill polled well in Boston and the eastern counties ( present @-@ day Maine ) , the Federalists won a decisive victory over the divided opposition . Since he was also nominated by one faction as lieutenant governor , Gill was again returned to that post . The principal issues in this and subsequent elections were over federal policy : specifically the national response to threats of war with Revolutionary France , and the consequent need for increased taxes to arm the nation . Gill 's politics are unclear : historian Anson Morse is of the opinion that his popularity was not sufficient to head the ticket of either the Federalists or the Democratic @-@ Republicans .

Focusing instead on the human need for companionship and understanding , Kaze noted that both Takao and Yukino lacked meaningful connections with their peers and friends , a view shared by reviewer Bradly Storm at Hardcore Gamer . Together through their conversations — in their \" garden of words \" — they found companionship : Takao finding someone he can share his passion with , and Yukino finding someone who treats her as a person . However , because of the age difference , this discovery varied between the characters . For Yukino , an older and more experienced individual , her hopeless feelings of lonely sadness disappeared when she learned she could connect with Takao , a revelation that she saw as her salvation . For Takao , a boy with an unsupportive family and friends who seemed more like acquaintances , he did not realize his lack of companionship until he discovered it with Yukino , a new feeling he mistook for romantic love but only realized its true nature after she had moved away . According to Kaze , \" romantic love could potentially bloom from such feelings , but that is not what the story is about \" . Instead , the love they shared was more basic , making the age difference immaterial . At the end of film , both characters maintained their friendship through letters , but otherwise began growing as people by moving on with their lives and presumably finding new relationships with other people . The hope was that one day they could reunite and renew their companionship \" without needing to cling to each other \" . However , neither could \" learn to walk again \" if they continued to isolate themselves from the rest of the world and take shelter with each other in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen ."

Ohio Representative Mary Rose Oakar also introduced legislation for a Susan B. Anthony dollar in October 1978 ; it proceeded rapidly through Congress and was signed by President Jimmy Carter . Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin . Anthony 's stern expression caused some to dub it the \" Susan B. Agony \" dollar . The Eisenhower dollar 's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar . Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces , the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2 , 1979 . It need not have worried ; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar , and production for circulation ceased after 1980 . Mint Director Stella Hackel Sims stated , \" people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar , but in time , they 'll become accustomed to the Susan \" . Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions , and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe ; both failed ."

Unlike games in the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest series , the battles are not turn based , but play out in real time . Players also do not directly control all of their characters actions , but instead chose battle strategies beforehand for all but one of their characters who then move and attack their closest enemy automatically . Added to First Departure was a combo attack system where special attacks stack to become more powerful . Players can equip characters with four special abilities with \" ranged \" and \" distance \" slots , whereas the remake reduced that number to two . Up to four characters can participate in battles , but the player is only able to control one character at a time , leaving the others to be controlled by the computer 's artificial intelligence .

All characters have a standard \" attack \" option , in which the character 's equipped item is used to attack whichever enemy the player has locked on to .

The 2005 film was \" obviously [ not as ] daring or revisionist \" as the 1995 adaptation but the youth of the film 's leads , Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen , was mentioned favourably over the 1995 cast , as Jennifer Ehle had formerly been \" a little too ' heavy ' for the role \" . The president of the Jane Austen Society of North America noted in an otherwise positive review that the casting of the 2005 leads was \" arguably a little more callow than Firth and Ehle \" and that \" Knightley is better looking than Lizzy should strictly be \" . The critical reception of MacFadyen 's Darcy , whose casting had proven difficult because \" Colin Firth cast a very long shadow \" , ranged from praise to pleasant surprise and dislike . Several critics did not observe any significant impact of Macfadyen 's Darcy in the following years . Garth Pearce of The Sunday Times noted in 2007 that \" Colin Firth will forever be remembered as the perfect Mr. Darcy \" , and Gene Seymour stated in a 2008 Newsday article that Firth was \" ' universally acknowledged ' as the definitive Mr. Darcy \" ."

After its foundation , Port Sarnia expanded throughout the 19th Century ; on 19 June 1856 , the residents passed the Act to Incorporate the Town of Sarnia and the name Port Sarnia was officially changed to Sarnia effective 1 January 1857 . The Act mentioned 1 @,@ 000 inhabitants in three wards . The wealth of adjoining stands of timber , the discovery of oil in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 by James Miller Williams , and the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1858 and the Grand Trunk Railway in 1859 all stimulated Sarnia 's growth . The rail lines were later linked directly to the United States by the opening of the St. Clair Tunnel under the St. Clair River at Sarnia in 1890 , by the Grand Trunk Railway , which was the first railroad tunnel ever constructed under a river . The tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day , achieved through the development of original techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment ."

Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative ( and future president ) Andrew Johnson , the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853 , allowing them to circulate . Until then , depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above ; the 1853 act lightened the silver coins from the half dime to the half dollar and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations . Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into dollar coins , but the high price of silver made it more profitable to use the bullion in other ways .

    "text": "A second influence on Durkheim 's view of society beyond Comte 's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism . Although he never explicitly exposed it , Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society . As an epistemology of science , realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual 's perception of them . This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism . Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception . According to empiricists , all realities are thus merely perceived : they do not exist independently of our perceptions , and have no causal power in themselves . Comte 's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations . Going beyond this , Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \" apparent \" laws , but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society ."

O 'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs ; some songs , such as \" Poor Places \" , only featured the Loose Fur trio . The album was completed in 2001 , and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards . The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart : A Film About Wilco ."

Often country case studies are used for these data . Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization . For example , Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights , gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance , and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy . Additionally , Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements , drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh .

The spectrum is dominated by emission lines , usually broad although the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense ionised nebulosity , especially the Weigelt Blobs . Most lines show a P Cygni profile but with the absorption wing much weaker than the emission . The broad P Cygni lines are typical of strong stellar winds , with very weak absorption in this case because the central star is so heavily obscured . Electron scattering wings are present but relatively weak , indicating a clumpy wind . Hydrogen lines are present and strong , showing that Eta Carinae still retains much of its hydrogen envelope . HeI lines are much weaker than the hydrogen lines , and the absence of HeII lines provides an upper limit to the possible temperature of the primary star . NII lines can be identified but are not strong , while carbon lines cannot be detected and oxygen lines are at best very weak , indicating core hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle with some mixing to the surface . Perhaps the most striking feature is the rich FeII emission in both permitted and forbidden lines , with the forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around the star ."

Firstly , the test meant that \" sting \" operations where the police purchased \" obscene \" materials were not considered sufficient evidence of publication , since the police were not considered easy to \" corrupt \" due to their regular exposure to the materials . It also meant that prosecutors often had to prove that purchasers were unaware of the obscene nature of material on sale prior to purchase , as those who actively sought out such material were deemed not likely to be corrupted by it . Secondly , the offer of such materials for sale was not held to be publication , since it was merely an invitation to treat . Thirdly , the courts held in Straker v DPP [ 1963 ] 1 QB 926 that negatives for photographs could not be forfeited if it was not intended to publish them , regardless of their obscene nature . As a result , the Act was amended by the Obscene Publications Act 1964 , which created the offence of \" possessing obscene articles for publication or sale \" and also extended \" obscene materials \" to cover photograph negatives . Another criticism levelled at both Acts was that they failed to define \" obscene \" properly , relying on the old , common law definition and giving no help to the judge or jury as to how to apply it properly .

The pyramid 's carvings , sculptures , and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian , Cambodian , and Aztec civilisations , while the regular shifting of the pyramid 's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film . According to Anderson , if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $ 20 million . However , in Prague they cost $ 2 million , an important factor when the film 's budget was less than $ 50 million ."

Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged , and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing .

The basis for the strategy was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703 , which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull , inspired by Patkul 's blueprint , advocated it as a way to lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest @-@ Litovsk . This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull 's troops stationed at Brest , which would force Charles to meet them in battle . At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony , ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed . The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt 's army , before Ogilvy 's troops approached Charles . Otherwise Ogilvy 's rear would be threatened . A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt at the same time as Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno . The belief was that there , behind fortifications , Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków . Meanwhile , von Paykull would attack with his combined Saxon – Polish force towards Warsaw in order to interrupt the coronation of Stanisław I."

    "text": "Like the Australian raven on mainland Australia , the Forest raven in Tasmania has a history of being shot or poisoned — generally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops . It is not protected under Tasmania 's Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them . Larger numbers of forest ravens ( alongside swamp harriers and brown falcons ) were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock . Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare , but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked , and hence their poor reputation was unjustified . Forest ravens may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion . Despite their fondness for roadkill , forest ravens are rarely hit by vehicles ."

    "text": "Mary and William Dyer were Puritans , as evidenced by their acceptance into the membership of the Boston church in New England . The Puritans wanted to complete the separation of the Anglican church from Catholicism that had begun under the rule of the English monarch Henry VIII . The conformists in England accepted the English monarch as the head of the church , and the form of worship that greatly resembled that in the Catholic church . The Puritans , as non @-@ conformists , wanted to do away with the vestments , bowing and making the sign of the cross that were prevalent in Anglican worship , and observe a much simpler and Biblical form of worship . Some of the non @-@ conformists , such as the Pilgrims , wanted to separate completely from the Anglican church , while the Puritans wished to reform the church from within . As the ranks of Puritans began swelling in England , so too did the severity of government intervention , including exile or death for ministers not adhering to the state religious practices . In the 1620s England 's King Charles I , with little understanding of religion , was adamant that English subjects conform to the same uniform religion , which included the vestments and procedures found in the Catholic church . As exploration of the North American continent was then leading to settlement , the Puritans found a way to practice their form of religion by emigrating from England ."

While working as an assistant coach at Michigan , Schulz has been credited with introducing the technique of overshifting a lineman on defense . In 1913 , Schulz developed a new blocking technique by shifting one of the linemen . Coach Yost was unconvinced until Schulz performed a demonstration using Michigan 's left guard Royce Traphagen . Schulz first put Traphagen in the line position designated by Yost , Schulz lined up on the other side of the line and charged , \" almost wrecking Traphagen \" . Then , Schulz had the groggy Traphagen line up in the spot designated by Schulz , and when Schulz charged he missed . Schulz implemented the overshift technique during the 1913 season ."

Further south , the road leading southeast from the city of Cortland , through Greene at the Chenango River , to Afton at the Susquehanna River ( a distance of 54 miles or 87 kilometres ) was an unnumbered road . In the 1930 state highway renumbering , the entire length of old NY 70 was incorporated into the newly established NY 41 . This new route was , at the time , designated from McClure ( beginning at an intersection with NY 17 ) through Afton and Greene to Cortland , where it met US 11 . NY 41 overlapped US 11 through Cortland to Homer , from where NY 41 used old NY 70 to reach US 20 in Skaneateles . The new Route 41 continued further north to the village of Jordan ( at NY 31 ) . The portion of the Skaneateles – Jordan highway between Elbridge and Jordan was previously known as NY 31A prior to 1930 . When initially created in 1930 , NY 41 was 112 miles ( 180 km ) long . A pair of state routes in the vicinity of Jordan were renumbered as spur routes of NY 31 c . 1933 . One of these was the portion of NY 41 north of Elbridge , which became NY 31C . NY 41 was truncated on its northern end to Skaneateles as part of the change . The south end of NY 41 was shifted slightly with the opening of the Quickway c . 1960 ."

The typical Dragon Quest plot involves the player controlling a party of heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain , who usually threatens the world in some way .

This linear plot @-@ line is intentional , to help ease the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them . The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when , and whether , to pursue certain storyline paths . To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game , no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and , to help ease players who may be apprehensive about whether they are on the right path , the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced at the beginning of the game . While the player never starts the game in a wholly non @-@ linear way , they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non @-@ linear manner following an early linear section of the game . Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels , although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases ."

On April 15 , 1997 , Robinson 's jersey number , 42 , was retired throughout Major League Baseball , the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major American sports leagues .

Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches , which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches . Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges . A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization , creation of roads , and other developments . The populations may not be declining as much as predicted , but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected . This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations . For bobcats , preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability .

Cutthroat trout were the first New World trout encountered by Europeans when in 1541 , Spanish explorer Francisco de Coronado recorded seeing trout in the Pecos River near Santa Fe , New Mexico .

As one of Lewis and Clark 's many missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during their expedition , cutthroat trout were given the name Salmo clarkii in honor of William Clark . In 1836 , the type specimen of S. clarkii was described by naturalist John Richardson from a tributary of the lower Columbia River , identified as the \" Katpootl \" , which was perhaps the Lewis River as there was a Multnomah village of similar name at the confluence .

Just three days later , her second daughter Princess Margaret died . On 13 February 2002 , the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House ; an ambulance and doctor were called , and the wound was dressed . She was still determined to attend Margaret 's funeral at St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , two days later on the Friday of that week , even though the Queen and the rest of the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor ; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating . Nevertheless , she flew to Windsor by helicopter , and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken — she insisted that she be shielded from the press — she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked – out windows , which had been previously used by Margaret . On 5 March 2002 , she was present at the luncheon of the annual lawn party of the Eton Beagles , and watched the Cheltenham Races on television ; however , her health began to deteriorate precipitately during her last weeks after retreating to Royal Lodge for the final time ."

    "text": "While the definition of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend their lives on the ocean , many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea . Most strikingly , many species breed many tens , hundreds or even thousands of miles inland . Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed ; for example , the snow petrel , the nests of which have been found 480 kilometres ( 300 mi ) inland on the Antarctic mainland , are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites . The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest , seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on . Other species , such as the California gull , nest and feed inland on lakes , and then move to the coasts in the winter . Some cormorant , pelican , gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all , spending their lives on lakes , rivers , swamps and , in the case of some of the gulls , cities and agricultural land . In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors . Some seabirds , principally those that nest in tundra , as skuas and phalaropes do , will migrate over land as well ."

Other innovations to occur immediately after 1932 , were the introduction of the AP Poll in 1934 , the tapering of the ends of the football in 1934 , the awarding of the first Heisman Trophy in 1935 , the first NFL draft in 1936 and the first televised game in 1939 .

The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance .

In January 1991 , Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces . The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia .

Fields were cultivated , as well as , within settlements , nearby gardens . Plowing was done using oxen and wooden , iron reinforced plows . Forest burning was used to increase the arable area , but also provided fertilizer , as the ashes lasted in that capacity for several seasons . Rotation of crops was practiced as well as the winter / spring crop system . After several seasons of exploitation the land was being left idle to regain fertility . Wheat , millet and rye were most important ; other cultivated plant species included oat , barley , pea , broad bean , lentil , flax , hemp , as well as apple , pear , plum , peach and cherry trees in fruit orchards . Beginning in the 8th century , swine gradually became economically more important than cattle ; sheep , goats , horses , dogs , cats , chickens , geese and ducks were also kept . The Slavic agricultural practices are known from archeological research , which shows progressive over time increases in arable area and resulting deforestation , and from written reports provided by Ibrahim ibn Yaqub , a 10th @-@ century Jewish traveler . Ibrahim described also other features of Slavic life , for example the use of steam baths . The existence of bath structures has been confirmed by archeology .

Six hours later , the storm accelerated to near 9 mph ( 15 km / h ) , meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected , preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane .

As part of this new role , he was expected to have attended the \" Grand National Exhibitions of Sporting and other Dogs \" at The Crystal Palace , London , annually between 1870 and 1872 .

In many single @-@ celled eukaryotes , their growth and division is linked to the cell cycle . For example , a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus . This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion . In other eukaryotes ( in mammals for example ) , mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell , rather than in phase with the cell cycle . When the energy needs of a cell are high , mitochondria grow and divide . When the energy use is low , mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive . In such examples , and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes , mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm . Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics , which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission , has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions ."

Some Khmer Loeu were forcibly moved to the lowlands to be educated in Khmer language and culture , ethnic Khmer from elsewhere in Cambodia were moved into the province , and roads and large rubber plantations were built . After facing harsh working conditions and sometimes involuntary labor on the plantations , many Khmer Loeu left their traditional homes and moved farther from provincial towns .

Norse sagas record traditions of a Danish king Knútr , who briefly ruled Northumbria around 900 . He is said to have been at first been repulsed by an English king called Adalbrigt north of Cleveland , but then to have defeated him at Scarborough . In 1987 , Smyth suggested that Adalbrigt may have been Æthelwold , but in 1995 Smyth put forward the alternative idea that the Northumbrian Danes may have accepted Æthelwold 's claim to be king of the West Saxons rather than taking him as their own king ."

Several organizations purchased frame houses or built their own between 1898 and 1907 , including Beta Theta Pi , Kappa Kappa Kappa , Phi Delta Alpha , and Psi Upsilon . The economic expansion of the 1920s created a boom in the fortunes of the fraternities , allowing many to build new brick residences near campus , including Zeta Psi , Kappa Kappa Kappa , Phi Sigma Kappa , Sigma Nu , Sigma Alpha Epsilon , Chi Phi , Theta Delta Chi , Phi Gamma Delta , Sigma Chi , Gamma Delta Chi , and Delta Tau Delta . It was during this period that Webster Avenue developed as \" fraternity row \" . The new residences were built without significant dining facilities , as the Trustees of the college had banned fraternities from serving regular meals in their chapter houses and had limited the number of resident brothers by the fall semester of 1909 . College administrators also challenged the fraternities to become more engaged in College life and less focused on their fraternity life during this time . College President Ernest Martin Hopkins personally decided to abolish freshman rush in 1924 ."

That night , after her granddad has fallen asleep , she slips out to have another look at the doll . Arriving at the toy shop , she sees that the doll is gone . Unseen by anyone , she enters the store . She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it . Hearing a clerk approaching , she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box . The doll rolls under the counter . The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box , thinking it contains the doll , which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe , a rich little girl . Arriving at Daisy 's house , Marie steps out of the box as soon as the room is empty . She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly . She decides to try them on , and soon a little cap , shoes and garments are on her figure . Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box . Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box , falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs . Marie lives up to her role well , imitating with stiff , jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls . Then Daisy eats , and Marie grows hungry as she watches . When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk , Marie reaches over and drinks it down . Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk . Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy 's wonderment is amusing to see . Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor . Here she is found by her granddad , who managed to trace her from the toy shop , and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie 's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself ! \""

In a reference frame that is in free fall alongside these bodies , they appear to hover weightlessly – but not exactly so . These bodies are not falling in precisely the same direction , but towards a single point in space : namely , the Earth 's center of gravity . Consequently , there is a component of each body 's motion towards the other ( see the figure ) . In a small environment such as a freely falling lift , this relative acceleration is minuscule , while for skydivers on opposite sides of the Earth , the effect is large . Such differences in force are also responsible for the tides in the Earth 's oceans , so the term \" tidal effect \" is used for this phenomenon ."

In a shoot ' em up , the player character engages in a lone assault , often in a spacecraft or aircraft , shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks . There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot ' em up . Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement ; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives . Shoot ' em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorize levels and enemy attack patterns . \" Bullet hell \" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles ."

A treaty to that effect was written and submitted , but it was not approved by the United States Senate . Six years later , on February 13 , 1878 , a separate treaty was ratified by the Senate that granted the Samoan government diplomatic recognition and reaffirmed permission to build a naval station in the country . Although there were no further political obstacles , funding for the station was not allocated and only a small coaling station was built on the island . Construction of the naval station did not begin until twenty years later , in 1898 , led by civilian contractors . In early 1899 , Tilley was assigned the task of overseeing the station construction and becoming its first commandant . He was also put in command of a collier , USS Abarenda , which would transport steel and coal to the construction site and to serve as the first station ship .

Responding to reports from ANGAU , the police and civilian informants , patrols searched the island for Japanese survivors . In a week of vigorous patrolling between 8 and 14 March 1943 , the 47th Infantry Battalion located and killed 72 Japanese , captured 42 , and found another nine dead on a raft . A remarkable coup was achieved by a patrol under Captain Joseph Pascoe that killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat @-@ bottomed boats . In the boats they found some documents in sealed tins . On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section , one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List , with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army . It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army , including many units that had never been reported before . Moreover , a mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit . Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan ."

    "text": "Francis Bacon ( no direct relation to Roger , who lived 300 years earlier ) was a seminal figure in philosophy of science at the time of the Scientific Revolution . In his work Novum Organum ( 1620 ) – a reference to Aristotle 's Organon – Bacon outlined a new system of logic to improve upon the old philosophical process of syllogism . Bacon 's method relied on experimental histories to eliminate alternative theories . In 1637 , René Descartes established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise , Discourse on Method , advocating the central role of reason as opposed to sensory experience . By contrast , in 1713 , the 2nd edition of Isaac Newton 's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica argued that \" ... hypotheses ... have no place in experimental philosophy . In this philosophy [ , ] propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction . \" This passage influenced a \" later generation of philosophically @-@ inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy . \" In particular , later in the 18th century , David Hume would famously articulate skepticism about the ability of science to determine causality and gave a definitive formulation of the problem of induction . The 19th century writings of John Stuart Mill are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method , as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation ."

He was frustrated with the outcome and the impact it would have on how the team would function for the remainder of the race .

The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was arguably the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements that was introduced in 1877 by letters patent issued by the Crown , though its function was very different from that of today 's Cabinet . The Council , which was composed of \" such persons and constituted in such manner as may be directed \" by royal instructions , existed to advise the Governor of the Straits Settlements and wielded no executive power . The Governor was required to consult the Executive Council on all affairs of importance unless they were too urgent to be laid before it , or if reference to it would prejudice the public service . In such urgent cases , the Governor had to inform the Council of the measures he had taken ."

Both of the combatants were killed . The estate remained with the Gerards , until it was bought by William Stanhope , who later became the first Earl of Harrington , and it remained with this family until 1935 .

It remains unclear whether their appearance had anything to do with the volcano eruption , or whether their discovery was due to more people observing the spectacular sunsets caused by the volcanic debris in the atmosphere . Studies have shown that noctilucent clouds are not caused solely by volcanic activity , although dust and water vapour could be injected into the upper atmosphere by eruptions and contribute to their formation . Scientists at the time assumed the clouds were another manifestation of volcanic ash , but after the ash had settled out of the atmosphere , the noctilucent clouds persisted . Finally , the theory that the clouds were composed of volcanic dust was disproved by Malzev in 1926 . In the years following their discovery , the clouds were studied extensively by Otto Jesse of Germany , who was the first to photograph them , in 1887 , and seems to have been the one to coin the term \" noctilucent cloud \" , which means \" night @-@ shining cloud \" . His notes provide evidence that noctilucent clouds first appeared in 1885 . He had been doing detailed observations of the unusual sunsets caused by the Krakatoa eruption the previous year and firmly believed that , if the clouds had been visible then , he would undoubtedly have noticed them . Systematic photographic observations of the clouds were organized in 1887 by Jesse , Foerster , and Stolze and , after that year , continuous observations were carried out at the Berlin Observatory . During this research , the height of the clouds was first determined , via triangulation . The project was discontinued in 1896 ."

St. Louis was ultimately named to the team as an injury replacement after Steven Stamkos was not medically cleared to play . At the same time , St. Louis requested a trade from Tampa Bay .

In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects , when startled while climbing on branches , to escape by dropping to the ground . Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly . The theory suggests that these lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax . Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings . This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings , starting with parachuting , then gliding and finally active flight . Still , lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory , as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation , and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field ."

Soldiers of Vietnamese Later Le dynasty had captured a Malaccan tributary mission en route to the Chinese Ming dynasty , killing some of them , and castrating and enslaving the survivors . Tonkin expressed their intent to conquer Malacca ; this intent was conveyed to the Chinese emperor in a later mission in 1481 . The Chinese emperor ordered Malacca to raise soldiers in the event of a similar attack . Malacca defeated the Vietnamese during an invasion of Lan Xang as reported in a Chinese account . The Malay Annals also mention a Cham prince taking some of his followers to form a small Cham colony in Malacca when Vietnam invaded Champa in 1471 , and deploying military assistance to Johor to fend off a botched military conquest in the 1590s . In the mid 17th @-@ century , the Cham vassal states Panduranga and Kelantan cultivated close diplomatic ties when they led a long @-@ term diplomatic mission to Kelantan to learn more about Malay culture and Islam .

During the quiescent periods , a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast . During the hyperactive period , more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean . Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP , and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late @-@ Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast .

Fritsch and Blomberg suddenly now claimed at the end of 1934 that as army officers they could not stand the exceedingly violent press attacks on Schleicher and Bredow that had been going on since July , which portrayed them as the vilest traitors , working against the Fatherland in the pay of France . In a speech given on January 3 , 1935 at the Berlin State Opera , Hitler stated that Schleicher and Bredow had been shot \" in error \" on the basis of false information , and that their names were to be restored to the honour rolls of their regiments at once . Hitler 's speech was not reported in the German press , but the army was appeased by the speech . However , despite the rehabilitation of the two murdered officers , the Nazis continued in private to accuse Schleicher of high treason . During a trip to Warsaw in January 1935 , Göring told Jan Szembek that Schleicher had urged Hitler in January 1933 to reach an understanding with France and the Soviet Union , and partition Poland with the latter , and Hitler had Schleicher killed out of disgust with the alleged advice . During a meeting with Polish Ambassador Józef Lipski on May 22 , 1935 , Hitler told Lipski that Schleicher was \" rightfully murdered , if only because he had sought to maintain the Rapallo Treaty \" . The statements that Schleicher had been killed because he wanted to partition Poland with the Soviet Union were later published in the Polish White Book of 1939 , which was a collection of diplomatic documents detailing German – Polish relations up to the outbreak of the war ."

IV. c.45 ) sparked renewed interest in incorporation . The act created the parliamentary borough of Stoke @-@ upon @-@ Trent , which would elect two members to Parliament . Together with Stoke @-@ upon @-@ Trent itself , the parliamentary borough also comprised Hanley , Shelton , Lane End , Fenton , Burslem , Tunstall , Rushton Grange , and the hamlet of Sneyd . The significance of the act was that for the first time and for one important reason only , through the election of Members of Parliament , the townships of the Potteries effectively became one . Shortly after the Reform Act came into effect , a Municipal Corporations Bill was introduced which proposed that the new parliamentary boroughs should be granted charters of incorporation . The bill failed with the prorogation of that Parliament , while the Potteries were excluded from the reforms of the later Municipal Corporations Act 1835 ( 5 & 6 Wm . IV. c.76 ) . Interest in incorporation was sufficient for several meetings on the subject to take place ; the Staffordshire Advertiser reported after one meeting in Burslem that incorporation would lead to one town having undue influence over the others , a theme that was to recur for many years . The same meeting revisited a topic raised pre – 1820 , the promotion of law and order in the Potteries , and called for the appointment of a stipendiary magistrate ."
