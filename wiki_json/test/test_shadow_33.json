    "text": "Prior to federation , the various Australian colonies could , and often did , charge tariffs on goods from the other colonies , ostensibly for the protection of their domestic manufacturing industries , mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne . For a border community such as the southern Riverina , these tariffs were a sore burden , making goods purchased from Melbourne , the closest large city , more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets . In addition , crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling , a popular activity . Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings . Along the Riverina the Murray was — and remains — part of New South Wales , who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney ."

    "text": "In the 1970s , many specimens of a previously unidentified were found associated together in the same bed and locality , a pebbly stratum near a route to Cerro Condor . The specimens were first described by Jose Bonaparte in 1979 . For the fossil he erected the genus Patagosaurus , as well as its type species P. fariasi . The generic name of Patagosaurus comes from the location of its find in Patagonia , and the fact that it is a reptile . The specific name honours Ricardo Farias , on whose land the initial discovery was made . The genus was originally known from an almost complete postcranial skeleton lacking a skull as the holotype , and many referred specimens however in 2003 it was found that a dentary was referable to the species , so more specimens are probably this taxon . Its skeleton was found near those of Piatnitzkysaurus and Volkheimeria in the Callovian to Oxfordian aged Patagonian deposits of the Cañadon Asfalto Formation . Patagosaurus is almost completely known , with many articulated specimens found covering almost all of the skeleton , including parts of the skull . Over twelve specimens have been referred to the species , although some of the material is probably from a unique taxon . Bonaparte ( 1986 ) assigned three specimens other than the holotype PVL 4170 , PVL 4076 , MACN CH 934 , and MACN CH 933 to the genus . While the holotype includes a post cranial skeleton , the others are known from cranial material and a nearly complete juvenile skeleton and skull . MACN CH 933 is directly comparable with the type material of Patagosaurus , which confirms its association with the genus . A specimen first referred to Patagosaurus in 2003 , MPEF @-@ PV 1670 ( which includes just a lower jaw ) , is also very similar to MACN CH 934 , and differences can be associated with age , so therefore , MPEF @-@ PV 1670 presumably represents adult cranial material . However , the teeth of MACN CH 934 are very different from those of both lower jaws ( MACN CH 933 and MPEF @-@ PV 1670 ) , so it can be identified as another sauropod from the same deposit as Patagosaurus . Thus , the taxon only certainly includes PVL 4170 , MACN CH 933 , and MPEF @-@ PV 1670 ."

From this perspective , the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles . The nine other cases involving points and lines may be viewed as limiting cases of the general problem . These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem ; for example , the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions , since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent ."

Uric acid ( UA ) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase , and is an intermediate product of purine metabolism . In almost all land animals , urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin , but in humans and most higher primates , the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional , so that UA is not further broken down . The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation . The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans . Studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high @-@ altitude hypoxia .

Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter . A second couple , also in masquerade , ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well . Ford conducts the double ceremony . Caius finds that instead of Nannetta , his bride is the disguised Bardolfo , and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta . Ford accepts the fait accompli with good grace . Falstaff , pleased to find himself not the only dupe , proclaims in a fugue , which the entire company sings , that all the world is folly , and all are figures of fun ( Tutto nel mondo è burla ... Tutti gabbati ! / \" Everything in the world is a jest ... \" ) ."

The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear 's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office , but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28 . Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February , claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license ; the suit said Planned Parenthood 's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications , as required by state law , and that Beshear 's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved . Planned Parenthood countered that , before the license could be finalized , the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection , requiring that abortions were already being performed there . In March , the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a transfer agreement with Planned Parenthood , saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement . A spokesman for Bevin denied that the pressure had come from anyone in the administration ."

Between 1989 and 1994 , The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh , 23 of them featured on the front page . At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period . Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a \" celebrity crime \" , and to Leigh being referred to as a \" celebrity victim \" . In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton , and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals , stating \" I think one of the main things is that people can identify with people involved . Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed I think it would be long forgotten . \""

Nearly all of the great minds of Western philosophy have found the argument worthy of their attention and criticism . The general consensus is that the argument is erroneous . However , consensus as to the exact nature of the argument 's error or errors has long proved elusive to the philosophical community . The first critic of the ontological argument was Anselm 's contemporary , Gaunilo of Marmoutiers . He used the analogy of a perfect island , suggesting that the ontological argument could be used to prove the existence of anything . This was the first of many parodies , all of which attempted to show that the argument has absurd consequences . Later , Thomas Aquinas rejected the argument on the basis that humans cannot know God 's nature . Also , David Hume offered an empirical objection , criticising its lack of evidential reasoning and rejecting the idea that anything can exist necessarily . Immanuel Kant 's critique was based on what he saw as the false premise that existence is a predicate . He argued that \" existing \" adds nothing ( including perfection ) to the essence of a being , and thus a \" supremely perfect \" being can be conceived not to exist . Finally , philosophers including C. D. Broad dismissed the coherence of a maximally great being , proposing that some attributes of greatness are incompatible with others , rendering \" maximally great being \" incoherent ."

Then , he reiterated the command , and again the concubines giggled . Sun Tzu then ordered the execution of the king 's two favored concubines , to the king 's protests . He explained that if the general 's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey , it was the fault of the officers .

Previously , many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels . Even after the passage of regulations , there continued to be criticisms about the availability of narcotics and around 1910 there was a wave of legislation aimed to strengthen requirements for their sale and remove what were commonly referred to as \" loopholes \" in poison laws . The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics , including cannabis , as poisons , limit their sale to pharmacies , and require doctor 's prescriptions . The first instance was in the District of Columbia in 1906 , under ' An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia , and for other purposes ' . This act was updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food , Drug , and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which remains in effect even today , creating a legal paradox for federal sentencing . Under this act , the framework for prescription and non @-@ prescription drugs and foods are set , along with standards as well as the enforcing agency , the FDA . \" Goods found in violation of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer .

The Jin hoped that a proxy state would be capable of administering northern China and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring Jurchen interventions to quell anti @-@ Jin uprisings . In 1127 , the Jurchens installed a former Song official , Zhang Bangchang ( 張邦昌 ; 1081 – 1127 ) , as the puppet emperor of the newly established \" Da Chu \" ( Great Chu ) dynasty . The puppet government did not deter the resistance in northern China , but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the Jurchens ' looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept Song court . A number of Song commanders , stationed in towns scattered across northern China , retained their allegiance to the Song , and armed volunteers organized militias opposed to the Jurchen military presence . The insurgency hampered the ability of the Jin to exert control over the north ."

The revenue disparity between large and small market teams , exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian dollar , led the Winnipeg Jets to relocate to Phoenix , Arizona in 1996 , becoming the Coyotes one year after the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver , Colorado to become the Colorado Avalanche . Hoping to prevent other teams from leaving Canada , and citing the cost of doing business in American dollars while taking revenue in Canadian dollars , the NHL set up a currency assistance plan to support the remaining small market Canadian teams in 1996 . The Hartford Whalers became the third former World Hockey Association team to relocate in 1997 , moving to Raleigh , North Carolina , to become the Carolina Hurricanes ."

Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb , as in * I know not — it can only be added to an auxiliary ( or copular ) verb , hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required , the auxiliary do is used , to produce a form like I do not ( don 't ) know . The same applies in clauses requiring inversion , including most questions — inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb , so it is not possible to say * Know you him ? ; grammatical rules require Do you know him ?"

The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor , and that in the process the blanket was soaked by clean water . The blanket would have been reusable when dry . Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself . The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself , and held that while it is true that the effect of the appellant 's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable , the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned . Further , the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared . Thus , both had sustained damage , albeit temporary ."

Over two centuries , they ignored the mountainous area in the central Sulawesi , where Torajans lived , because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land . In the late 19th century , the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of Islam in the south of Sulawesi , especially among the Makassarese and Bugis peoples . The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as potential Christians . In the 1920s , the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the Dutch Reformed Church began missionary work aided by the Dutch colonial government . In addition to introducing Christianity , the Dutch abolished slavery and imposed local taxes . A line was drawn around the Sa 'dan area and called Tana Toraja ( \" the land of Toraja \" ) . Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the Luwu kingdom that had claimed the area . In 1946 , the Dutch granted Tana Toraja a regentschap , and it was recognized in 1957 as one of the regencies of Indonesia ."

The metal corset was popularly claimed to have been introduced to France by Catherine de ' Medici in the 16th century , although this is now considered a myth . The idea that such garments were worn for fashionable purposes is debatable , with fashion historians now regarding such claims sceptically .

This served as a base of operations that allowed the Spanish to extend their control towards the Ocosingo valley . One of the scarce mentions of Portocarrero 's campaign suggests that there was some indigenous resistance but its exact form and extent is unknown . The Coxoh Maya , who inhabited a small area along the San Gregorio River between Comitán and the Guatemalan border , were probably conquered in 1528 .

Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the French First Republic that emerged from the Revolution in 1799 , and subsequently attempted to marginalise the Bastille as a symbol . Napoleon was unhappy with the revolutionary connotations of the Place de la Bastille , and initially considered building his Arc de Triomphe on the site instead . This proved an unpopular option and so instead he planned the construction of a huge , bronze statue of an imperial elephant . The project was delayed , eventually indefinitely , and all that was constructed was a large plaster version of the bronze statue , which stood on the former site of the Bastille between 1814 and 1846 , when the decaying structure was finally removed . After the restoration of the French Bourbon monarchy in 1815 , the Bastille became an underground symbol for Republicans . The July Revolution in 1830 , used images such as the Bastille to legitimise their new regime and in 1833 , the former site of the Bastille was used to build the July Column to commemorate the revolution .

Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley , on the northwestern borders of Wessex , however , and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west . No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia , but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria , so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship ."

Charles Lyell recognised the implications of Wallace 's paper and its possible connection to Darwin 's work , although Darwin did not , and in a letter written on 1 – 2 May 1856 Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish priority . Darwin was torn between the desire to set out a full and convincing account and the pressure to quickly produce a short paper . He met Lyell , and in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker affirmed that he did not want to expose his ideas to review by an editor as would have been required to publish in an academic journal . He began a \" sketch \" account on 14 May 1856 , and by July had decided to produce a full technical treatise on species . His theory including the principle of divergence was complete by 5 September 1857 when he sent Asa Gray a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas ."

The show 's creators based each bending style on an existing Chinese martial art , leading to clear visual and physical differences in the techniques used by Waterbenders ( tai chi ) , Earthbenders ( Hung Ga kung fu ) , Firebenders ( Northern Shaolin kung fu ) and Airbenders ( Baguazhang ) . In addition to these four types of bending , there are several minor subcategories of bending within them , including but not limited to : Metalbending , Sandbending ( Earth ) ; Lightning generation and redirection ( Fire ) and Bloodbending , Healing , Plantbending ( Water ) ."

The parallel tubes at these three tunnels would open on November 26 , 1968 ; the same day as the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels . The original tubes were subsequently remodeled . Both the new and remodeled tunnels would have fluorescent lighting , white tile walls , and 13 ft ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) -wide lanes . The portals of the new tunnels were designed to resemble those of the original tunnels . Reconstruction of the original Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel was completed in October 1970 , while work on refurbishing the original Kittatinny and Blue Mountain tunnels was finished on March 18 , 1971 . With the completion of these projects , the entire length of the highway was four lanes wide . With the completion of these projects , the stretch of roadway passing through the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill tunnels became known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike . The turnpike commission continued to maintain the tunnels for a few years , but eventually abandoned them . The abandoned stretch deteriorated ; signs and guardrails were removed , pavement started crumbling , trees grew in the median , and vandals and nature began taking over the tunnels . The turnpike commission still performed some maintenance on the abandoned stretch and used it for testing pavement marking equipment . In 2001 , the turnpike commission turned over a significant portion of the abandoned section to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy ; bicycles and hikers could use the former roadway . The abandoned stretch of the turnpike is the longest stretch of abandoned freeway in the United States ."

Albertosaurus was named first , so by convention it is given priority over the name Gorgosaurus , which is sometimes considered its junior synonym . William Diller Matthew and Barnum Brown doubted the distinction of the two genera as early as 1922 . Gorgosaurus libratus was formally reassigned to Albertosaurus ( as Albertosaurus libratus ) by Dale Russell in 1970 , and many subsequent authors followed his lead . Combining the two greatly expands the geographical and chronological range of the genus Albertosaurus . Other experts maintain the two genera as separate . Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie claims there are as many anatomical differences between Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus as there are between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus , which are almost always kept separate . He also notes that undescribed tyrannosaurids discovered in Alaska , New Mexico and elsewhere in North America may help clarify the situation . Gregory S. Paul has suggested that Gorgosaurus libratus is ancestral to Albertosaurus sarcophagus ."

Some eliminativists , such as Frank Jackson , claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function ; others , such as Georges Rey , claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses . Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues and it is possible to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other . The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars , W.V. Quine , Paul Feyerabend , and Richard Rorty . The term \" eliminative materialism \" was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty .

In many cases , the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path , and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships , and their location in relation to the storm , it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm 's center of circulation for a given point in time . This is the manner in which all of the five known storms in the 1907 season were identified by hurricane expert José Fernández @-@ Partagás 's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910 . Partagás also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars . The information Partagás and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database ( HURDAT ) , with some slight adjustments . HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity , although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed , listings on some storms are incomplete ."

As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment , Donlevy 's alcoholism presented challenges for the production . Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day : “ He [ Donlevy ] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up . He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around . They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said , “ What 's this movie called ? ” and they said , “ Well , it 's called Quatermass 2 ” . He said , “ I 've got to say all that ? There 's too much talk . Cut down some of the talk ” . He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go , so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was ” . Val Guest has denied Kneale 's claims , saying “ So many stories have been concocted since , about how he was a paralytic [ drunk ] . It 's absolute balls , because he was not paralytic . He wasn 't stone cold sober either , but he was a pro and he knew his lines ” . Guest also recalled , “ By after lunch he would come to me and say “ Give me a breakdown of the story so far .

Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop . In September 822 , Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf 's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king , which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop . After Ceolwuf 's deposition in 823 Wulfred 's situation improved . The new Mercian king , Beornwulf , presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred 's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down . Coenwulf 's daughter Cwenthryth , abbess of Winchcombe and Minster , paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent . Later in 825 ( or possibly the following year ) , however , Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun . Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold , and coinage in Wulfred 's name appears to have ceased for a time , though it had been restored before Wulfred 's death in 832 . Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston , shortly before Egbert 's death ."

The petition reached 2 @,@ 000 signatures by May 30 and 5 @,@ 000 by June 1 . However , Electronic Arts dropped the game . The publisher 's Jeff Brown said that the decision \" was based on our deep uncertainty that the project could meet any schedule given the changes in senior management and a history of missing deadlines . \" Brown told the website Combatsim that Electronic Arts had \" worked diligently \" with Looking Glass for more than two years , and that , although the game had missed its planned October 1999 release , they had been willing to delay the project into 2000 .

A judgment call that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game , but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game . As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players , MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer @-@ scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game .

    "text": "While Wilde had long been famous for dialogue and his use of language , Raby ( 1988 ) argues that he achieved a unity and mastery in Earnest that was unmatched in his other plays , except perhaps Salomé . While his earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious , Earnest achieves a pitch @-@ perfect style that allows these to dissolve . There are three different registers detectable in the play . The dandyish insouciance of Jack and Algernon — established early with Algernon 's exchange with his manservant — betrays an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes . The formidable pronouncements of Lady Bracknell are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions . In contrast , the speech of Dr. Chasuble and Miss Prism is distinguished by \" pedantic precept \" and \" idiosyncratic diversion \" . Furthermore , the play is full of epigrams and paradoxes . Max Beerbohm described it as littered with \" chiselled apophthegms — witticisms unrelated to action or character \" , of which he found half a dozen to be of the highest order ."

This loss of manpower led to a shortage of farm labour , and a corresponding rise in wages . The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost . To curb the rise in wages , the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 , followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351 . These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run , but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour .

Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC , and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate . In 22 , 21 , and 19 BC , the people rioted in response , and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years , ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus . Likewise , there was a food shortage in Rome in 22 BC which sparked panic , while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis . After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate , Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome 's grain supply \" by virtue of his proconsular imperium \" , and ended the crisis almost immediately . It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a praefectus annonae , a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome ."

Although most of Lichtenstein 's war imagery depicts American war themes , this depicts \" a scarred German submarine captain at a battle station \" . The manner of depiction with the commander 's face pressed against the periscope reflects fusions of industrial art of the 1920s and 1930s . The ironic aspect of this in 1963 is in part due to its temporal displacement referring back to World War II during the much later period of the Cold War . The styling of the balloon content , especially that of the large font characters , is complemented by or complementary to the other traditional visual content of the painting . Lichtenstein 's alterations heightened the sense of urgency in the image , however , they also offset that menace by forming a detached work . A November 1963 Art Magazine review stated that this was one of the \" broad and powerful paintings \" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli 's Gallery ."

Nevertheless , the effects of the action on the wider war were hugely important . The losses suffered by the Dutch Navy in ships , men and morale gave the Royal Navy superiority in the North Sea , a position enhanced by the disruption the battle caused to French negotiations for an alliance with what historian Edward Pelham Brenton describes as the \" Northern Powers \" of Scandinavia . The destruction of the Dutch fleet at Camperdown was also a serious blow to French ambitions to invade Ireland , and denied their Atlantic fleet of essential reinforcements ; it may even have played a part in Napoleon Bonaparte 's decision to abandon efforts to attack Britain directly early in 1798 . In 1799 , a significant British and Russian expeditionary force landed in the Netherlands supported by a large fleet under Lord Duncan . Assailed from both sea and land , the remainder of the Dutch Navy under Admiral Story capitulated without a fight : in what became known as the Vlieter Incident , the political divisions between the officers and seamen resulted in a mutiny during which the Dutch sailors threw their ammunition overboard . In Britain , the public relief at the restoration of the Navy 's authority in the aftermath of the spring mutinies was enormous and helped steady the wavering British government in their pursuit of the war by restoring confidence in British naval supremacy in home waters .

    "text": "The archetypal example of this situation is antithrombin , which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state . The primary specificity determining residue ( the P1 arginine ) points toward the body of the serpin and is unavailable to the protease . Upon binding a high @-@ affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long @-@ chain heparin , antithrombin undergoes a conformational change , RCL expulsion , and exposure of the P1 arginine . The heparin pentasaccharide @-@ bound form of antithrombin is , thus , a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa . Furthermore , both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites ( called exosites ) for heparin . Heparin , therefore , also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin , further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties . After the initial interaction , the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released . This interaction is physiologically important . For example , after injury to the blood vessel wall , heparin is exposed , and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response . Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux , a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti @-@ clotting drug ."

Their method of ambush is to float a few feet below the surface , and wait for unsuspecting prey to swim within reach . They lunge forward , and with a sweeping motion grab their prey , impaling it on their double rows of sharp teeth ."

The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories . From the 1040s onwards , however , successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being \" governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre \" and established \" its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction , separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler \" , in the words of historian Richard Huscroft . After the 1140s , these principles had been largely accepted within the English church , albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome . These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question . Pope Innocent was , according to historian Ralph Turner , an \" ambitious and aggressive \" religious leader , insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church ."

The condition most often confused with serotonin syndrome is neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) . The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features which can make differentiating them difficult . In both conditions , autonomic dysfunction and altered mental status develop . However , they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction ( serotonin excess vs dopamine blockade ) . Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity . Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine . Dopamine receptor blockade ( NMS ) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a neuroleptic drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine ."

They got together to think about what they would believe to be a big political story that would affect politics in the United Kingdom in within twelve to eighteen months after their initial meetings early in 2008 .

Sometime through the writing process , the producers set up a story @-@ arc , Sugarhorse , to be a threat throughout the series and have it resolved by the finale . The writers enjoyed making the Sugarhorse storyline because it was one of the instances that \" really brings Harry to the edge \" and causing him to doubt everything he has done or achieved . The writing team took several meetings together to discuss what it is and how it should work into the storyline . Christian Spurrier noted it was \" kind of a headache \" to figure out how to \" weave it in \" to the series and work out what parts would be used in which episodes . The producers wanted to use a scene relating to Sugarhorse as the finale scene of every episode it was featured in , as the producers believed it would provide a \" right hook \" to the audience . Adding the new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying , truth , and who the characters should trust ."

Since most investigators posit a mass greater than 10 M ☉ , the most likely scenario is that the supergiant will continue to burn and fuse elements until its core collapses , at which point Betelgeuse will explode as a supernova , leaving behind a neutron star remnant about 20 km in diameter .

Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance , and ruddy , purplish , or dark in colour ; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood . Indeed , blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin and its left eye was often open . It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in , and its teeth , hair , and nails may have grown somewhat , though in general fangs were not a feature .

Murad II died and was succeeded by Mehmed the Conqueror whilst Constantine XI Palaiologos succeeded John VIII . Constantine XI and Mehmed did not get along well ; the former 's successful conquests of Crusader territory in the Peloponnese alarmed the latter , who had since subjugated as vassals the crusaders in the region , and Mehmed had around 40 @,@ 000 soldiers sent to nullify these gains . Constantine XI threatened to rebel against Mehmed unless certain conditions were met by the Sultan regarding the status quo . Mehmed responded to these threats by building fortifications in the Bosporus and thus closed Constantinople from outside naval assistance . The Ottomans already controlled the land around Constantinople and so they began an assault on the city on 6 April 1453 . Despite a union of the Catholic and Orthodox Churches , the Byzantines received no official aid from the Pope or Western Europe , with the exception of a few soldiers from Venice and Genoa ."

To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions , Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California , Berkeley , in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe , John Van Vleck , Edward Teller , Emil Konopinski , Robert Serber , Stan Frankel , and Eldred C. Nelson , the latter three former students of Oppenheimer , and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè , Felix Bloch , Franco Rasetti , John Henry Manley , and Edwin McMillan .

Parents in India sometimes dedicated their female children to the Hindu temples , where they became \" devadasis \" . Traditionally a high status in society , the devadasis were originally tasked with maintaining and cleaning the temples of the Hindu deity to which they were assigned ( usually the goddess Renuka ) and learning skills such as music and dancing . However , as the system evolved , their role became that of a temple prostitute , and the girls , who were \" dedicated \" before puberty , were required to prostitute themselves to upper class men .

This led to an uprising the same year among Betsimisaraka , particularly including the bandits and other outlaws who had long been living according to their own law in the eastern rainforests ; the movement extended to the broader Betsimisaraka population , who mounted a strong resistance to French rule between 1897 @-@ 1899 . These efforts were eventually subdued . After regaining control , the French colonial authority took steps to address the repercussions of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom , providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations , but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists ."

It is also suspected of being a mycorrhizal associate of subshrub rock roses in the genus Helianthemum .

A similar growth @-@ enhancing effect had been noted earlier with Pinus taiwanensis seedlings .

Following Martin Luther 's and John Calvin 's Reformation , Puritans believed that the Bible was the only true source of religious teaching and that any additions made to Christianity had no place in Christian practice , especially with regard to church traditions , such as clerical vestments or the use of Latin in church services . In particular , they were strongly opposed to the Anglicans ' episcopal form of church government . They believed that the church was a community of Christians who made a covenant with God and with one another . Their congregations had a democratic structure . Ministers , teachers , and lay church elders were elected by and responsible to the entire congregation ( Calvinist Federalism ) . Each congregation was independent of all the others and directly subject to God 's ( or Christ 's ) government ( theocracy ) , hence the name Congregationalism . The Pilgrims distinguished themselves from the Puritans in that they sought to \" separate \" themselves from the Anglican Church , rather than reform it from within .

During the non @-@ breeding season , some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat , or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of Iran . Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range , it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List . The Sind sparrow is social within small groups while feeding and breeding , and during its winter dispersal . It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects , foraging close to the ground . Nests are made in the branches of thorny trees , and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material . Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young , and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season ."

A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations , such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest . Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations . Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants ; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable . Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology . The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization . Small patches of lower quality ( i.e. , sinks ) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants . A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year , where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable . Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure ."

A study in the Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest 's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods . The hartebeest has much lower food intake than the other members of Alcelaphini . The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems . In addition to this , it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses . These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season , which is usually a difficult period for grazers . For instance , in comparison with the roan antelope , the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available .

In between are the humerus ( arm ) , radius ( forearm ) , elbow joint , ulna ( elbow ) , carpus ( knee ) bones and joint , large metacarpal ( cannon ) , small metacarpal ( splint ) , sesamoid , fetlock joint , first phalanx ( long pastern ) , pastern joint , second phalanx ( short pastern ) , coffin joint and third phalanx ( coffin or pedal ) bones . Each hind limb of the horse runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone . After the pelvis come the femur ( thigh ) , patella , stifle joint , tibia , fibula , tarsal ( hock ) bone and joint , large metatarsal ( cannon ) and small metatarsal ( splint ) bones . Below these , the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints is the same as in the forelimbs . When the horse is moving , the distal interphalangeal joint ( coffin joint ) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body , and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques . Although having a small range of movement , the proximal interphalangeal joint ( pastern joint ) is also influential to the movement of the horse , and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs . Due to the horse 's development as a cursorial animal ( one whose main form of defense is running ) , its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground , without the need for grasping , lifting or swinging . The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow , while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal ( knee ) joint , which corresponds to the wrist in humans . A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs . These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus , approximately 17 million years ago ."

The modern Avon is navigable from its mouth at Avonmouth , through the Floating Harbour in Bristol , as far as Pulteney Weir in the centre of Bath and just beyond the start of the canal . Beyond Pultney Weir the Avon is still navigable as far as the weir and site of the old \" flash lock \" at Bathampton but the lock at Pultney has been replaced only with a small boat slide for dinghies and canoes . The stretch from Bristol to Bath is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs at Hanham , Keynsham , Swineford , Saltford , Kelston and Weston , which together overcome a rise of 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) within 12 miles ( 19 km ) . Lock number one on the Kennet and Avon Canal is Hanham Lock , first opened as part of the Avon Navigation in 1727 . It is the first lock east of Netham , the upstream limit of the Floating Harbour , beyond the suburbs of the city of Bristol . A colliery wharf was sited just west of the lock , but the nearby coal mines closed in the 19th century . The river below Hanham Lock is considered to be tidal , as high tides often pass over the weir at Netham . Some spring tides pass over the weir at Hanham , making the river tidal up to Keynsham Lock . Heading east , the river passes the Somerdale Factory , on its southern bank , which was a chocolate production factory for Cadbury plc – originally built by the Fry family in the 1920s and ' 30s . On the northern bank is Cleeve Wood , the primary scientific importance of which lies in its particularly large population of Bath Asparagus ( Ornithogalum pyrenaicum ) .

Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony , but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany . Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia . He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues , like navigation rights on the Rhine . The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy , where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army . On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia . Metternich wanted no rash change of course , and at first there was little impact on the Congress . Finally , on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting . On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150 @,@ 000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances . After the military commanders left , the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work , fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands , formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons , and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland .

However , the feet are very large to distribute load when walking on snow or thin ice and to provide propulsion when swimming ; they may measure 30 cm ( 12 in ) across in an adult . The pads of the paws are covered with small , soft papillae ( dermal bumps ) , which provide traction on the ice . The polar bear 's claws are short and stocky compared to those of the brown bear , perhaps to serve the former 's need to grip heavy prey and ice . The claws are deeply scooped on the underside to assist in digging in the ice of the natural habitat .

Punch believed that the ruling demonstrated that operations intended to arrest suspects should be conducted by civilian police officers , rather than soldiers . The case is considered a landmark in cases concerning Article 2 , particularly in upholding the principle that Article 2 , paragraph 2 , defines circumstances in which it is permissible to use force which may result in a person 's death as an unintended consequence , rather than circumstances in which it is permissible to intentionally deprive a person of their life .

A broadly shared language , island , monarch , religion and Bible ( the Authorized King James Version ) further contributed to a growing cultural alliance between the two sovereign realms and their peoples . The Glorious Revolution of 1688 resulted in a pair of Acts of the English and Scottish legislatures — the Bill of Rights 1689 and Claim of Right Act 1689 respectively — which ensured that the shared constitutional monarchy of England and Scotland was held only by Protestants . Despite this , although popular with the monarchy and much of the aristocracy , attempts to unite the two states by Acts of Parliament in 1606 , 1667 , and 1689 were unsuccessful ; increased political management of Scottish affairs from England had led to \" criticism \" , and strained Anglo @-@ Scottish relations ."

    "text": "Pali Dome , located north and northeast of Mount Cayley , is an eroded volcano in the central Mount Cayley volcanic field . Like Cauldron Dome , it consists of two geological units . Pail Dome East is composed of a mass of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material . It lies on the eastern portion of the Powder Mountain Icefield . Much of the lava flows form gentle topography at high elevations but terminate in finely jointed vertical cliffs at low elevations . The first volcanic activity likely occurred about 25 @,@ 000 years ago , but it could also be significantly older . The most recent volcanic activity produced a series of lava flows that were erupted when the vent area was not covered by glacial ice . However , the flows show evidence of interaction with glacial ice in their lower units . This indicates that the lavas were erupted about 10 @,@ 000 years ago during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation . The ice @-@ marginal lava flows reach thicknesses of up to 100 m ( 330 ft ) . Pali Dome West consists of at least three andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic material ; its vent is presently buried under glacial ice . At least three eruptions have occurred at Pali Dome East . The age of the first volcanic eruption is unknown , but it could have occurred in the past 10 @,@ 000 years . The second eruption produced a lava flow that was erupted when the vent area was not buried under glacial ice . However , the flow does show evidence of interaction with glacial ice at its lower unit . This indicates that the lavas were erupted during the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation . The third and most recent eruption produced another lava flow that was largely erupted above glacial ice , but was probably constrained on its northern margin by a small glacier . Unlike the lava flow that was erupted during the second eruption , this lava flow was not impounded by glacial ice at its lower unit . This suggests that it erupted less than 10 @,@ 000 years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation retreated ."

This was quicker and easier than non @-@ destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment , especially once supplies of the vine began to run low . In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession . Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10 km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening . In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective . In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines . This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902 . By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held more than one million plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation . Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure due in part to the fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor . Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper . Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber , as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years . These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber . In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903 , which was 1000 tons . By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting , leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants . The entirety of the Lulonga concession , to the west of Abir , produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905 ."

The colonists had rebelled against the rule of the proprietors , and Nicholson was appointed in response to their request for crown governance . The rebellion had been prompted by inadequate response by the proprietors to Indian threats , so Nicholson brought with him some British troops . He established a council composed primarily of supporters of the rebellion , and gave it significant latitude to control colonial affairs . As he had in some of his other posts , he used enforcement of the Navigation Acts as a means to crack down on political opposition . He established local governments modeled on those he set up in Maryland and Virginia , including the 1722 incorporation of Charleston . He expended both public money and his own to further both education and the Church of England , and introduced ground @-@ breaking judicial administration into the colony . He negotiated agreements and territorial boundaries with the Cherokee , and promoted trade , pursuing policies similar to those he had advocated while in Maryland and Virginia . He introduced a commissioner of Indian affairs into the colonial government , a post that survived until the crown assumed the duties of managing Indian affairs in the 1750s ."

The smaller design also did not feature the speed advantage over opponents that the battlecruisers had . For these reasons the Navy \" strongly recommended against the construction of such a ship \" , and the proposal was abandoned ."

Knowles \" Contemporary proof of passing occurs from at least January 1872 . In January 1872 the following account is given against Derby : \" W. Orton , by a specimen of careful play , running the ball up in close proximity to the goal , from which it was returned to J. Marsh , who by a fine straight shot kicked it through \" This play taking place \" in close proximity to the goal \" suggests a short pass and the \" return \" of the ball to Marsh suggests that this was the second of two passes . This account also goes onto describe other interesting early tactics : \" This goal was supplemented by one of T. Butler 's most successful expositions of the art of corkscrew play and deceptive tactics which had the effect of exciting the risibility of the spectators \" Similarly the following contemporary account of passing comes from January 1872 : \" the only goal scored in the match was obtained by Sheffield , owing to a good run up the field by Steel , who passed it judiciously to Matthews , and the latter , by a good straight kick , landed it through the goal out of reach of the custodian \" . This match ( against Notts ) also provided contemporary evidence of \" good dribbling and kicking \" particularly by W.E. Clegg . The condition of the ground , however , \" militated against a really scientific exhibition \" , suggesting that at other times their play was even more \" scientific \" . Their play in March 1872 was described as \" speed , pluck and science of no mean order \""

In the Sonoran Desert , Couch 's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow . Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others . Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates . As the desert dries out , the adult toads rebury themselves . The juveniles stay on the surface for a while , feeding and growing , but soon dig themselves burrows . Few make it to adulthood . The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls .

Only a handful of earldoms had existed under Henry I and these had been largely symbolic in nature . Stephen created many more , filling them with men he considered to be loyal , capable military commanders , and in the more vulnerable parts of the country assigning them new lands and additional executive powers . Stephen appears to have had several objectives in mind , including both ensuring the loyalty of his key supporters by granting them these honours , and improving his defences in key parts of the kingdom . Stephen was heavily influenced by his principal advisor , Waleran de Beaumont , the twin brother of Robert of Leicester . The Beaumont twins and their younger brother and cousins received the majority of these new earldoms . From 1138 onwards , Stephen gave them the earldoms of Worcester , Leicester , Hereford , Warwick and Pembroke , which — especially when combined with the possessions of Stephen 's new ally , Prince Henry , in Cumberland and Northumbria — created a wide block of territory to act as a buffer zone between the troubled south @-@ west , Chester , and the rest of the kingdom .

However , Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised . The first of these was the Human Potential Movement , which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential , and which accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed , thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life . Hanegraaff described transpersonal psychology as the \" theoretical wing \" of this Human Potential Movement ; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought , transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of altered states of consciousness . Closely connected to this is the shamanic consciousness current , which argues that the shaman was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and which seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth ."

Amidi wrote that the show was a sign of \" the end of the creator @-@ driven era in TV animation \" . Amidi 's essay expressed concern that assigning a talent like Faust to a toy @-@ centric show was part of a trend towards a focus on profitable genres of animation , such as toy tie @-@ ins , to deal with a fragmented viewing audience , and overall \" an admission of defeat for the entire movement , a white flag @-@ waving moment for the TV animation industry . \" Although the article said this concern was over the fact that more and more shows seem to be driven by company executives who want to sell their products , rather than creators . Though the show had been discussed on 4chan 's cartoon forum before the essay 's publication , the alarmist nature of the essay led to more interest in the show , resulting in a positive response for the series for its plot , characters , and animation style . This reaction soon spread to the other boards of 4chan , where elements of the show quickly inspired recurring jokes and memes on the site . Some of these included adopting phrases from the show like \" anypony \" , \" everypony \" , and \" nopony \" , instead of \" anybody \" , \" everybody \" , and \" nobody \" , or jokingly stating that they watch the show for the \" plot \" , a reference to the ponies ' flanks ."

Wesley 's Articles of Religion , adopted by the Methodist Episcopal Church ( a precursor of the United Methodist Church ) in 1784 , assume in Articles XVIII that wine is to be used in the Lord 's supper and in Article XIX that it should given to all the people , not ministers only as in the Catholic practice of the time . Bishops in America Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury comment on the latter article saying , \" St. Paul does not complain of [ the lay Corinthians ' ] drinking the wine at the Lord 's supper ... but of their both eating and drinking most intemperately \" ( emphasis in original ) . Asbury strongly urged citizens to lay aside the use of alcohol . Likewise , the listed duties for Methodist preachers indicate that they should choose water as their common drink and use wine only in medicinal or sacramental contexts , with Coke and Asbury commenting that frequent fasting and abstinence are \" highly necessary for the divine life . \""

The species was placed in the genus Persoonia by Karel Domin in 1921 . The genus names Linkia and Persoonia had been coined in 1798 , but the latter was officially conserved . The species name is the Latin adjective levis , meaning \" smooth \" , and refers to the hairless foliage . Christiaan Hendrik Persoon coined the name Persoonia salicina for it in his 1805 work Synopsis Plantarum , and queried whether Cavanilles ' Linkia levis was in fact P. lanceolata .

The House on Mango Street takes place in Chicago where the narrator lives , and in Mexico City where she visits extended family . Caramelo primarily takes place in those settings as well , but part of the book details the narrator 's experiences as a teenager in San Antonio , TX . Various characters in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories also make trips to Mexico to reunite with family members . However , to quote literary critics Jesús Benito and Ana María Manzanas , the \" image of the border has become fully meaningful not only when we consider it as a physical line but when we decenter it and liberate it from the notion of space to encompass notions of sex , class , gender , ethnicity , identity , and community . \" Cisneros frequently divorces the border from its strictly geographic meaning , using it metaphorically to explore how Chicana identity is an amalgamation of both Mexican and Anglo @-@ American cultures . The border represents the everyday experiences of people who are neither fully from one place nor the other ; at times the border is fluid and two cultures can coexist harmoniously within a single person , but at other times it is rigid and there is an acute tension between them . Literary critic Katherine Payant has analyzed the border metaphor in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories , which manifests in references to the Chicana / o characters ' Mexican roots and the ( im ) migration between the two countries , the recurrence of overlapping pre @-@ Columbian , mestizo and Southwestern Chicano myths , and the portrayal of Chicanas / os as \" straddling two or three cultures . \" Payant makes use of Gloria Anzaldúa 's concept of living \" on the borderlands \" to describe the experience of Cisneros 's Chicana characters who , in addition to their struggle to overcome patriarchal constructs of their gender and sexual identity , must negotiate linguistic and cultural boundaries ."

The provinces were grouped into twelve dioceses , each governed by an appointed official called a vicarius , or \" deputy of the praetorian prefects \" . Some of the provincial divisions required revision , and were modified either soon after 293 or early in the fourth century . Rome herself ( including her environs , as defined by a 100 miles ( 160 km ) -radius perimeter around the city itself ) was not under the authority of the praetorian prefect , as she was to be administered by a city prefect of senatorial rank – the sole prestigious post with actual power reserved exclusively for senators , except for some governors in Italy with the titles of corrector and the proconsuls of Asia and Africa . The dissemination of imperial law to the provinces was facilitated under Diocletian 's reign , because Diocletian 's reform of the Empire 's provincial structure meant that there were now a greater number of governors ( praesides ) ruling over smaller regions and smaller populations . Diocletian 's reforms shifted the governors ' main function to that of the presiding official in the lower courts : whereas in the early Empire military and judicial functions were the function of governor , and procurators had supervised taxation ; under the new system vicarii and governors were responsible for justice and taxation , and a new class of duces ( \" dukes \" ) , acting independently of the civil service , had military command . These dukes sometimes administered two or three of the new provinces created by Diocletian , and had forces ranging from two thousand to more than twenty thousand men .

Produced using new Silicon Graphics , Inc . ( SGI ) Onyx workstations acquired by Square , the demo was Square 's first foray into 3D graphics , and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console , which also used SGI hardware . Square , however , had not yet committed to Nintendo 's console at the time of the demo 's production , and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation . The demo itself featured Terra Branford , Locke Cole , and Shadow in a series of battles . The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures : for example , moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack ."

In a Swedish study , coal tits and goldcrests foraged in the outer foliage , while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy . In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced , goldcrests and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy , but did not do so where the larger tits were retained .

Accompanied by disorganized convective activity , development , if any , was expected to be slow . A broad area of low pressure subsequently formed within the wave about halfway between Africa and the Cape Verde Islands . Embedded within an elongated trough , the weak system struggled to organize and convection soon diminished . Interaction with a monsoon trough reinvigorated shower and thunderstorm activity on August 11 across a large area southwest of the Cape Verde Islands , but the surface low had dissipated by this time .

Captain Thomas Cheap of Britannia engaged Vengeur while Captain John Canning of Nonsuch attacked Résolu at 10 : 45 and were soon supported by William Pitt and Houghton .

    "text": "At hatching , a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids , teeth in both upper and lower jaws , three pairs of feathery external gills , a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins . The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond @-@ living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water . Pond @-@ type larvae often have a pair of balancers , rod @-@ like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment . Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form , but this varies with species and with populations . The northwestern salamander ( Ambystoma gracile ) is one of these and , depending on environmental factors , either remains permanently in the larval state , a condition known as neoteny , or transforms into an adult . Both of these are able to breed . Neoteny occurs when the animal 's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine . Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food , lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics . The tiger salamander ( Ambystoma tigrinum ) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process . The adult tiger salamander is terrestrial , but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state . When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land , larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out . There are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders , including species of Necturus , Proteus and Amphiuma , and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances ."

Newfoundland is not typical of either biome , as it lacks much of the plant and animal life that are characteristic to these biomes .

In the address , Kimball envisioned the LDS Church moving beyond sending American missionaries to other nations to where those nations would be able to furnish enough missionaries for their own countries with extras to send to India , China , and the Soviet Union , all large nations where the LDS Church was then unable to proselytize . Kimball challenged the attendees to \" lengthen your stride \" , a phrase which was later used to define Kimball 's presidency . Many in attendance recorded being spiritually awestruck by Kimball 's address . One wrote : \" It was as if , spiritually speaking , our hair began to stand on end .... We realized that President Kimball was opening spiritual windows and beckoning us to come and gaze with him on the plans of eternity . \""

The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper . Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode \" Countrycide \" was deliberately structured in order to make the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life . For Davies , the dalliance is a \" human \" one , told in an adult manner characterised by \" lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair \" . Myles commented that Gwen 's compromised morality , as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience , and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were \" safe \" from temptation .

Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate , Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a \" one @-@ dimensional paragon of virtue \" . Instead , the writers made Gwen more \" realistic \" by giving her \" distinct human failings \" , which Walker felt made her \" arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars \" .

These towers — many complete with crenellations and machicolations — were actually mostly rebuilt during the 19th century . At the rear of the palace the original medieval fortifications seem untouched by time . ( Illustration 4 ) .

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that \" both justifications for the search @-@ incident @-@ to @-@ arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply \" , when \" there is no possibility \" that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence . In Trupiano v.

It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest . But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest . \" In United States v. Rabinowitz ( 1950 ) , the Court reversed Trupiano , holding instead that the officers ' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest . Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the \" immediate control \" of the arrestee could be searched , but it did not define the term . In deciding Chimel v.

The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to \" modern cellphones , which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy , \" and noted that US citizens ' cellphones today typically contain \" a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate . \""

Jewish circumcision is part of the brit milah ritual , to be performed by a specialist ritual circumciser ( a mohel ) on the eighth day of a newborn son 's life ( with certain exceptions for poor health ) . Jewish law requires that the circumcision leave the glans bare when the penis is flaccid .

They argue that Rome 's expansion was driven by short @-@ term defensive and inter @-@ state factors ( that is , relations with city @-@ states and kingdoms outside Rome 's hegemony ) , and the new contingencies that these decisions created .

The next few decades witnessed some lingering confusion as to the correct taxonomical placement of these fungi . In 1907 , Jean Boudier moved both G. esculenta and H. infula into a newly created genus he called Physomitra ; he retained the genus Gyromitra but \" based it on an entirely different character so as to exclude from the genus the very species on which it was founded \" . In an attempt to reconcile the confusion surrounding the naming and identity of the two mushrooms , Fred J.

He was replaced with Kikuta when Ito was forced to drop Secret of Mana due to other demands on his time , such as the soundtrack to Romancing SaGa . It was Kikuta 's first video game score . Encountering difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the SNES , Kikuta tried to express in the music two \" contrasting styles \" to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music . Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself , spending nearly 24 hours a day in his office , alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be , according to him , \" immersive \" and \" three @-@ dimensional \" . Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time , Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the SNES . These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system 's hardware , so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the SNES . Kikuta said in 2001 that he considered the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation ."

However , after the reign of Emperor Wu , his court culture began to be criticized as having placed undue emphasis on the grandiose language in fu and therefore having missed opportunities to encourage moral restraint . The most prominent critic of \" grand fu \" was the other great fu writer of the Han dynasty : Yang Xiong . As a youth , Yang was an admirer and imitator of Sima Xiangru 's fu , but later came to disapprove of grand fu . Yang believed that the original purpose of fu was to \" indirectly admonish \" ( fèng 諷 ) , but that the extended rhetorical arguments and complex vocabulary used in grand fu caused their hearers and readers to marvel at their aesthetic beauty while missing their moral messages . Yang juxtaposed early Han dynasty fu with the fu @-@ like expositions in the Classic of Poetry , saying that while those in the Poetry provided moral standards , the fu of the Han poets \" led to excess \" .

    "text": "The value of staggered tuning is best explained by first looking at the shortcomings of tuning every stage identically . This method is called synchronous tuning . Each stage of the amplifier will reduce the bandwidth . In an amplifier with multiple identical stages , the 3 dB points of the response after the first stage will become the 6 dB points of the second stage . Each successive stage will add a further 3 dB to what was the band edge of the first stage . Thus the 3 dB bandwidth becomes progressively narrower with each additional stage ."

    "text": "Normally , the ratio of ventilation to perfusion is about one @-@ to @-@ one ; the volume of air entering the alveoli ( ventilation ) is about equal to that of blood in the capillaries around them ( perfusion ) . This ratio is reduced in pulmonary contusion ; fluid @-@ filled alveoli cannot fill with air , oxygen does not fully saturate the hemoglobin , and the blood leaves the lung without being fully oxygenated . Insufficient inflation of the lungs , which can result from inadequate mechanical ventilation or an associated injury such as flail chest , can also contribute to the ventilation / perfusion mismatch . As the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion grows , blood oxygen saturation is reduced . Pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction , in which blood vessels near the hypoxic alveoli constrict ( narrow their diameter ) in response to the lowered oxygen levels , can occur in pulmonary contusion . The vascular resistance increases in the contused part of the lung , leading to a decrease in the amount of blood that flows into it , directing blood to better @-@ ventilated areas . Although reducing blood flow to the unventilated alveoli is a way to compensate for the fact that blood passing unventilated alveoli is not oxygenated , the oxygenation of the blood remains lower than normal .

Infantry , cavalry , and some special units automatically group themselves into formations — groups of soldiers that receive attack and defense bonuses — when at least eight of that kind of unit is present ; the maximum number of units a formation may consist of is sixty @-@ four . The unit 's speed , attack , defensive capabilities , and range vary , depending on several factors ; these include their civilization ; unit type ; the upgrades that have been purchased ; whether or not they are in formation , and , if so , its size . Three resources — wood , gold , and glory — are used to build structures , train units , purchase upgrades ; a fourth resource , stamina , is spent using \" hero mode . \" Wood and gold are deposited in settlements , or one of their various upgrades , such as town centers . Glory and stamina are both earned : glory by building and fighting , and stamina when the hero unit kills an enemy . In several RTS games , upgrades — sometimes called \" Ages \" — are available that represent time periods or technological levels ; Rise and Fall uses a similar concept . When upgrades to the hero — called \" Levels \" in this game — are purchased with glory , new technologies , upgrades , units , and advisors are unlocked . Advisors — paid for with glory as well — provide civilization @-@ specific benefits and bonuses to the player 's army and economy . Outposts , guarded by artificial intelligence soldiers , — soldiers who defend automatically — also play an important part in Rise and Fall .

    "text": "Once on the ground , snow can be categorized as powdery when light and fluffy , fresh when recent but heavier , granular when it begins the cycle of melting and refreezing , and eventually ice once it comes down , after multiple melting and refreezing cycles , into a dense mass called snow pack . When powdery , snow moves with the wind from the location where it originally landed , forming deposits called snowdrifts that may have a depth of several meters . After attaching itself to hillsides , blown snow can evolve into a snow slab — an avalanche hazard on steep slopes . The existence of a snowpack keeps temperatures lower than they would be otherwise , as the whiteness of the snow reflects most sunlight , and any absorbed heat goes into melting the snow rather than increasing its temperature . The water equivalent of snowfall is measured to monitor how much liquid is available to flood rivers from meltwater that will occur during the following spring . Snow cover can protect crops from extreme cold . If snowfall stays on the ground for a series of years uninterrupted , the snowpack develops into a mass of ice called glacier . Fresh snow absorbs sound , lowering ambient noise over a landscape because the trapped air between snowflakes attenuates vibration . These acoustic qualities quickly minimize and reverse , once a layer of freezing rain falls on top of snow cover . Walking across snowfall produces a squeaking sound at low temperatures ."

A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein Man had been aged about 18 to 20 at the time of his death and had been well muscled . Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body ; the murder weapon had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung .

After Hygeberht became archbishop , he consecrated Ecgfrith as king ; the ceremony took place within a year of Hygeberht 's elevation . It is possible that Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony , and that Offa needed an alternative archbishop for that purpose . The ceremony itself is noteworthy for two reasons : it is the first recorded consecration of any English king , and it is unusual in that it asserted Ecgfrith 's royal status while his father was still alive . Offa would have been aware that Charlemagne 's sons , Pippin and Louis , had been consecrated as kings by Pope Adrian , and probably wished to emulate the impressive dignity of the Frankish court . Other precedents did exist : Æthelred of Mercia is said to have nominated his son Coenred as king during his lifetime , and Offa may have known of Byzantine examples of royal consecration ."

Among the thousands of fossils found , he recognized a few isolated cheek teeth as belonging to a hyena , which he named Hyaena neogaea in 1839 . After more material was found ( including canine teeth and foot bones ) , Lund concluded the fossils instead belonged to a distinct genus of felid , though transitional to the hyenas . He stated it would have matched the largest modern predators in size , and was more robust than any modern cat . Lund originally wanted to name the new genus Hyænodon , but realizing this had recently become preoccupied by another prehistoric predator , he instead named it Smilodon populator in 1842 . He explained the Ancient Greek meaning of Smilodon as σμίλη ( smilē ) , a scalpel or two @-@ edged knife , and ὀδoύς ( odoús ) , tooth . This has also been translated as \" tooth shaped like double @-@ edged knife \" . He explained the species name populator as \" the destroyer \" , which has also been translated as \" he who brings devastation \" . By 1846 , Lund had acquired nearly every part of the skeleton ( from different individuals ) , and more specimens were found in neighboring countries by other collectors in the following years . Though some later authors used Lund 's original species name neogaea instead of populator , it is now considered an invalid nomen nudum ( \" naked name \" ) , as it was not accompanied with a proper description and no type specimens were designated . Some South American specimens have been referred to other genera , subgenera , species , and subspecies , such as Smilodontidion riggii , Smilodon ( Prosmilodon ) ensenadensis , and S. bonaeriensis , but these are now thought to be junior synonyms of S. populator ."

The group agreed to a five @-@ point legislative program : 1 ) No public school integration would be tolerated in Virginia ; 2 ) School districts which integrated would lose state funding ; 3 ) The state law permitting school districts to be sued would be repealed ; 4 ) The power to assign students to schools would be taken away from local school boards and transferred to the governor ; and 5 ) The governor would have the power to close any school district which integrated . Despite the group 's many public statements supporting local control of schools , Tuck later remarked that the purpose of the plan was to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia : \" If they [ other Virginia areas ] won 't stand with us then I say make ' em . We cannot compromise . ... If you ever let them integrate anywhere the whole state will be integrated in a short time . \" Byrd in particular was a vocal supporter of the school closing proposal , and helped draft the other proposals in the plan ."

Democrats had hoped on a big turnout , as the district is nearly a quarter African American , a reliable Democratic constituency . Analysis of the race suggested that Mount 's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin 's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout . The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout . Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W.

Following her defeat , Mount ruled out another campaign for the seat , but not a campaign for another state @-@ wide office ."

In July 1974 , Belle S.

Her successor , Barbara B.

Content and innovation beat out technology , a formula that Nintendo is using right now with the continued ascendance of the DS and Wii . \" Buchanan later went on to praise some parts of the Game Gear 's library , however , stating \" Some of those Master System tweaks were very good games , and fun is resilient against time . \" Retro Gamer praised Sega 's accomplishment in surviving against the competition of Nintendo in the handheld console market with the Game Gear , noting that \" for all the handhelds that have gone up against the might of Nintendo and ultimately lost out , Sega 's Game Gear managed to last the longest , only outdone in sales by the Sony PSP .

This approach , however , brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing , body heat and the use of computers and electric lighting . Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems . The Scottish Parliament Building , however , reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20 % of the accommodation by a variety of strategies . Natural ventilation is used wherever possible . A computerised management system senses the temperature in different parts of the Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool . During summer months , the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day.This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing , occupants and electrical equipment . Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25 metres ( 80 ft ) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities . The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment 's Environmental Assessment Method ( BREEAM ) ."

About 11 hours later , the hurricane made landfall near Avalon , New Jersey , with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . In 1992 , Jerry Jarrell , later director of the National Hurricane Center , estimated a barometric pressure of 990 mbar ( 29 inHg ) at landfall , which would be the lowest in association with the hurricane .

They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact . The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative . Two options were available to the flight crew . The DC @-@ 10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost , the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors . Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically , and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity . An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position . This lever has the added benefit of unlocking the outboard ailerons , which are not used in high @-@ speed flight and are locked in a neutral position . The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them . They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system . Although the gear deployed successfully , there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft ."

These methods are often not practical due to high cost , introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms , or health and safety issues for the operator . Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A. luteobubalina . In one study , thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A. luteobubalina and one of the saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor , Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon ; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A. luteobubalinea . These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests , where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A. luteobubalina on the stump base ."

Maulay regained Upavon in 1233 , after the king reopened the case . Henry justified his action as being exercised \" per voluntatem nostrum \" , or through his own will . Henry opened a case of quo warranto , and then declined to recognize his own charter as valid , thus granting the manor to Maulay . Although the case could be made that Maulay 's right to the manor was better than Basset 's , it is more probable that the dispute over Upavon and its ownership was the opening move in an effort to curtail the influence of Richard Marshall , the Earl of Pembroke . It was also an attempt to turn back grants made by the king to de Burgh 's supporters , now that de Burgh had fallen from power . The royal actions led to conflict between Henry III and the barons , because of Henry 's grant of the manor to Basset . The restoration to Maulay and Basset 's deprivation were considered illegal by many of the nobles , and led to a revolt by Basset and Marshal , who was Basset 's overlord . Maulay was seen as a non @-@ Englishman who was profiting over a popular English noble , Basset . Maulay was briefly in disgrace but managed to return to favour , and was named constable of Devizes in January 1234 , his first royal appointment since 1221 .

The religious fundamentalism of the Puritans created a cuisine that was austere , disdainful of feasting and with few embellishments . Eating was seen as a largely practical matter and one of the few occasions when New Englanders would engage in massive bouts of eating and drinking was at funerals , times when even children might drink large amounts of alcohol . Age was one of the most important signs of authority and determined eating practices ; though Puritan society was less stratified , particularly compared to the southern colonies , heads of the household and their spouses would often eat separately from both children and servants . Though New England had a great abundance of wildlife and seafood , traditional East Anglian fare was preferred , even if it had to be made with New World ingredients . Baked beans and pease porridge were everyday fare , particularly during the winter , and usually eaten with coarse , dark bread . At first it was made with a mixture of wheat and maize ( corn ) , but after a disease called wheat rust struck in the 1660s , it was made of rye and maize , creating what has later been known as \" rye ' n ' injun \" . Vegetables with meat boiled thoroughly was a popular dish , and unlike many other regions in North American colonies , they were cooked together , rather than separately , and frequently without seasoning .

Work on the line began in 1865 , but proceeded very slowly ; progress was blocked by local landowners , legal processes , and financial problems . Sharpe was managing the project largely from Paris , through a series of agents . By the latter part of 1864 the stress was adversely affecting his health , so in 1865 he spent some time in Italy to recuperate . Following his return the difficulties continued to mount , and in 1867 he renounced his concession . The line was eventually taken over by the State , and was not fully completed until about 1877 . At some point Sharpe bought property and iron ore mines along the route of the line ."

Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters ( e.g. , blue hook stars ) , or feature multiple populations . The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time , or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance , has likewise been overturned ( e.g. , NGC 2808 ) . Further , the morphology of the cluster stars in a color @-@ magnitude diagram , and that includes the brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members , can be influenced by observational biases . One such effect is called blending , and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low @-@ resolution observations multiple ( unresolved ) stars may appear as a single target . Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star ( e.g. , an RR Lyrae variable ) is erroneously too bright , given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined . Consequently , the computed distance is wrong , and more importantly , certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder , and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant ."

Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems . Upon missile detonation , the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations ( yawing ) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged .

Between Thespis and Trial by Jury , Gilbert and Sullivan did not collaborate on any further operas , and each man separately produced works that further built his reputation in his own field . Gilbert wrote several short stories , edited the second volume of his comic Bab Ballads , and created a dozen theatrical works , including Happy Arcadia in 1872 ; The Wicked World , The Happy Land and The Realm of Joy in 1873 ; Charity , Topsyturveydom and Sweethearts in 1874 .

He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot , which the prince killed and served as food . The elder concluded that he was \" a gun that loads itself . \" The oldest son , Andrianjakanavalonamandimby , was given a pot of honey , which he smashed in order to eat every last drop . Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid , implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself . He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney ( considered unpalatable ) , which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless , leading the elder to remark , \" This man can 't even resist the temptation to eat the kidney . \" He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver 's stake , which the prince 's wife demanded he give to them , demonstrating their greediness . Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga , carrying an axe and a rope . The prince asked to borrow the two items , then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu , put some of the best meat in a basket , cook the rest of the good meat for their meal , and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket . The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village . When Andriamampandry was about to leave , the prince returned the rope and axe , gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife , and gave him the second basket , declaring \" These are the parts for the axe ( i.e. the neck ) and the rope ( i.e. the striated omasum ) . \" Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince . He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona , who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house , then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there . Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow , but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this , and Andriamampandry rebuked him , remarking \" You are the king , and yet you do not understand ? \""

After studying law , he embarked on a successful career as a lawyer in Constantinople , which brought him to the attention of Empress Theodora . In 534 , on account of his rhetorical skills , he was employed as an imperial envoy to the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna . At the time , a power struggle was developing there between Queen Amalasuntha , regent to the young king Athalaric , and her cousin Theodahad . Following the death of Athalaric , Theodahad usurped the throne , imprisoned Amalasuntha , and sent messages to Emperor Justinian hoping for recognition . Peter met the envoys at Aulon , on his way to Italy , and notified Constantinople , seeking new instructions . Emperor Justinian ordered him to convey the message to Theodahad that Amalasuntha was under the Emperor 's protection and not to be harmed . Nevertheless , at the time Peter arrived in Italy , Amalasuntha had been killed ; Procopius 's narrative in the Gothic War is ambiguous here , but in his Secret History , he explicitly claims that Peter arranged the murder of Amalasuntha on instructions from Theodora , who feared her as a potential rival for Justinian 's attentions . Whatever assurances might have been privately given by Theodora to Theodahad , in public , Peter strongly condemned the act , and declared that there would be \" war without truce between the emperor and themselves \" as a result ."

The last Southern state to create an institution for the Black deaf was Louisiana in 1938 . Black Deaf children thus became a language community isolated from the White Deaf with different means of language socialization , allowing for different dialects to develop . Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children , Oralism — the prominent pedagogical method of the time — was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students . Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language , so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than their White peers . Despite the decision in Brown v.

The bird had most likely been brought alive to Europe , as it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships , and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens . Most tropical specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet . It had probably lived in the emperor 's zoo for a while together with the other animals painted for the same series .

In 1951 Martin Cooper of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Massenet 's detractors , including some fellow composers , were on the whole idealistic , even puritanical , \" but few of them have in practice achieved anything so near perfection in any genre , however humble , as Massenet achieved in his best works . \" In 1955 Edward Sackville @-@ West and Desmond Shawe @-@ Taylor commented in The Record Guide that , although usually dismissed as an inferior Gounod , Massenet wrote music with a distinct flavour of its own . \" He had a gift for melody of a suave , voluptuous and eminently singable kind , and the intelligence and dramatic sense to make the most of it . \" The writers called for revivals of Grisélidis , Le jongleur de Notre @-@ Dame , Don Quichotte and Cendrillon , all then neglected .

Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake , Iowa , Holly chartered a four @-@ seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane at Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City , Iowa , for himself , Jennings , and Allsup , to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead , Minnesota . Following the Clear Lake show ( which ended around midnight ) , Tommy Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens , while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson , who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size . When Holly learned that his band mates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to take the bus rather than fly , a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued , and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow : Holly jokingly told Jennings , \" Well , I hope your ol ' bus freezes up ! \" Jennings jokingly replied , \" Well , I hope your ol ' plane crashes ! \" Less than an hour and a half later , shortly after 1 : 00 AM on February 3 , 1959 ( later known as The Day the Music Died ) , Holly 's charter plane crashed at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City , Iowa , instantly killing all on board ."

He was the older brother of politician Clifford Sifton . He attended public schools across southern Ontario , culminating with a boys ' school in Dundas and high school in London .

The Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presents Canada 's music industry awards , the Juno Awards , which were first awarded in 1970 . The Canadian Music Hall of Fame established in 1976 honours Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements . Patriotic music in Canada dates back over 200 years as a distinct category from British patriotism , preceding the first legal steps to independence by over 50 years . The earliest , The Bold Canadian , was written in 1812 . The national anthem of Canada , \" O Canada \" , was originally commissioned by the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec , the Honourable Théodore Robitaille , for the 1880 St. Jean @-@ Baptiste Day ceremony , and was officially adopted in 1980 . Calixa Lavallée wrote the music , which was a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe @-@ Basile Routhier .

Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer , he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah , who was the designated head of state for Pakistan . Jinnah was keen to attract some of the larger border states , hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab . He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose , giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms , which he would sign . Jaisalmer refused , arguing that it would be difficult for him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems . Hanwant Singh came close to signing . However , the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan . Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two @-@ nation theory on which Partition was based , and was likely to cause communal violence in the State . Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments , and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India ."

    "text": "On the early Earth , reactive elements , such as iron and uranium , existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms . Oxygen would not be able to build up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted ( producing banded iron formations ) , and all the other reactive elements had been oxidised . Donald Canfield detected records of the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared – and the presence of atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation . Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses ; the rise of small , sessile ( stationary ) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event , with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation . However , the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism , with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous ."
