Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them , and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous . The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth , so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships . Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships , and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils , they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships . Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland , it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects . Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated , and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant , animal , and mineral parts . Greenland , free of its icy burden , rises up , ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands . As the chapter ends , the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe ."

To easily describe small differences , however , oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage ( ‰ ) or part per thousand ( ppt ) instead of using percents . The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34 ‰ mark , while those in the South are closer to 35 ‰ . The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor . The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world 's oceans : sodium ( Na ) and chloride ( Cl ) make up about 85 % . Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium ( Mg ) and calcium ( Ca ) and negative ions such as sulfate ( SO ₄ ) , carbonate ( CO ₃ ) , and bromides . In the absence of other pollution , seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline ; similarly , it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated . For scientific and technical purposes , a standardized form of artificial seawater is often used ."

On the other hand , Gazis returned . In the following years , however , the periodical was subsidized by the princes of Moldavia , Scarlat Callimachi and Michael Soutzos . Apart from the difficulties faced , 1816 was a turning point , as two scholars and adherents of Korais , Theoklitos Farmakidis and Konstantinos Kokkinakis , were placed in charge . Consequently , Hermes o Logios actually became an outlet for Korais and continued to appear without interruption until the Greek War of Independence ."

One historian writes that \" in no case was a soldier whom the medical staff certified as suffering from shell shock actually executed \" , that \" there appear to have been very few cases where men who alleged shell shock , but whose claim was denied , were actually executed \" , and that the suggestions of modern campaigners that most of the executed men suffered from shell shock are \" palpably untrue \" .

The word traditionally translated and discussed as \" design \" is gnōmē and Socrates is reported by Xenophon to have pressed doubting young men to look at things in the market , and consider whether they could tell which things showed evidence of gnōmē , and which seemed more to be by blind chance , and then to compare this to nature and consider whether it could be by blind chance . In Plato 's Phaedo , Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras ' concept of a cosmic nous as the cause of the order of things , was an important turning point for him . But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras ' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine , because of Anaxagoras ' materialist understanding of causation . Socrates complained that Anaxagoras restricted the work of the cosmic nous to the beginning , as if it were uninterested and all events since then just happened because of causes like air and water . Socrates , on the other hand , apparently insisted that the demiurge must be \" loving \" , particularly concerning humanity . ( In this desire to go beyond Anaxagoras and make the cosmic nous a more active manager , Socrates was apparently preceded by Diogenes of Apollonia . )"

    "text": "Transparency is common , even dominant , in animals of the open sea , especially those that live in relatively shallow waters . It is found in plankton of many species , as well as larger animals such as jellyfish , salps ( floating tunicates ) , and comb jellies . Many marine animals that float near the surface are highly transparent , giving them almost perfect camouflage . However , transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different refractive indices from seawater . Some marine animals such as jellyfish have gelatinous bodies , composed mainly of water ; their thick mesogloea is acellular and highly transparent . This conveniently makes them buoyant , but it also makes them large for their muscle mass , so they cannot swim fast . Gelatinous planktonic animals are between 50 and 90 per cent transparent . A transparency of 50 per cent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as cod at a depth of 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) ; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water , where the light is brighter and predators can see better .

The latter gesture scandalized his superiors , particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law , which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long . After some assessment , his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience . He was temporarily suspended in practice but , citing an ambiguity in the decision ( which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity ) , Creangă considered himself defrocked . He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere , a matter which caused public outrage ."

For the next decade , she would go on to become one of top five commercial actresses in Bollywood along with Sridevi , Madhuri Dixit , Meenakshi Sheshadri and Jaya Prada . Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities . The first film she worked on was Saagar , directed by Ramesh Sippy , after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting . She first performed a screen test , which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and \" literally shivering \" while making it . To her surprise , Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the lead part opposite her Bobby co @-@ star Rishi Kapoor . Scripted with her in mind , the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle , but its one @-@ year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before , the first of which was Zakhmi Sher ( 1984 ) . Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia , including one scene in which she was seen topless for a split second . The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India 's official entry to the Oscars that year . Kapadia 's performance as Mona D 'Silva , a young woman from Goa who is torn between her friend ( Kamal Haasan ) and the man she loves ( Kapoor ) , won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards . A review by Asiaweek labelled her \" a delight \" . Rediff.com noted , \" Dimple , caught between a friend and lover , performed solidly and memorably , grounding the two male leads and making the film work . \" A 1993 issue of India Today wrote , \" Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty . She looked ravishing : auburn hair , classical face , deep eyes , an aura of sensuality . It was clear she was back . \""

To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs , he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level , and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land . He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) , as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610 ft ( 1 @,@ 405 m ) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations . In Darwin 's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents , and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation .

Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier , however , particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time . For instance , lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young ( once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother ) , who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride . In addition to greater protection , the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size , and thus have an equal chance of survival . If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness , for instance , then the younger cubs , being much smaller than their older brethren , usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes – consequently , death by starvation is more common among the younger cubs ."

The Hampi temple ( mentioned above ) is a World Heritage site and the most important of Vitthala 's temples outside Maharashtra . Constructed in the 15th century , the temple is believed to have housed the central image from Pandharpur , which the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya took \" to enhance his own status \" or to save the image from plunder by Muslim invaders . It was later returned to Pandharpur by Bhanudas ( 1448 – 1513 ) , the great @-@ grandfather of poet @-@ saint Eknath . Today , the temple stands without a central image , though between 1516 and 1565 , most important transactions , which would have been carried out previously in the presence of the original state deity Virupaksha ( a form of Shiva ) , were issued in presence of the central image of Vitthala . Three of Madhvacharya 's eight mathas ( monasteries ) in Karnataka — Shirur , Pejavara and Puttige — have Vitthala as their presiding deity . A Vitthaleshwara temple stands at Mulbagal , Karnataka . In Tamil Nadu , Vitthala shrines are found in Srirangam , Vittalapuram near thiruporur and in Tirunelveli district , and Thennangur , Govindapuram near Kumbakonam and sculptures are also found in Kanchi ."

In 1981 , the second year of production , the composition of the medallions was changed ; although the 90 % gold purity was retained , the balance was altered to include silver , which was added to change their appearance . That year 's medallions depicted Mark Twain and Willa Cather . These were designed by Matthew Poloso and Sherl Winter , respectively . These first four medallions bore no notation of their metallic content or country of origin . This was done to distinguish them from federal coinage .

These black touches contrast or even attempt to take over the purity of the white elements . Others , such as Kile M. Ortigo of Emory University , agree with this interpretation and point to the Sulaco with its \" sterilized , white interior \" as representing this element in the second film of the franchise ."

He was so taken by Zelda that he redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in This Side of Paradise to resemble her . He wrote , \" all criticism of Rosalind ends in her beauty , \" and told Zelda that \" the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four . \" Zelda was more than a mere muse , however — after showing Scott her personal diary , he used verbatim excerpts from it in his novel . At the conclusion of This Side of Paradise , the soliloquy of the protagonist Amory Blaine in the cemetery , for example , is taken directly from her journal ."

In the 1950s and 1960s , however , the roles were pervasive and not limited to North America : from 1940 to 1970 , butch / femme bar culture flourished in Britain , though there were fewer class distinctions . They further identified members of a group that had been marginalized ; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in . Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period . Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations , and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates ."

    "text": "Before and after the publication of the score in 1922 , scholars questioned the work 's authenticity , and its attribution to Monteverdi continued to be in some doubt until the 1950s . The Italian musicologist Giacomo Benvenuti maintained , on the basis of a 1942 performance in Milan , that the work was simply not good enough to be by Monteverdi . Apart from the stylistic differences between Il ritorno and Monteverdi 's other surviving late opera , L 'incoronazione di Poppea , the main issue which raised doubts was the series of discrepancies between the score and the libretto However , much of the uncertainty concerning the attribution was resolved through the discovery of contemporary documents , all confirming Monteverdi 's role as the composer . These documents include a letter from the unknown librettist of Le nozze d 'Enea in Lavinia , which discusses Monteverdi 's setting of Il ritorno . There is also Badoaro 's preface to the Il ritorno libretto , addressed to the composer , which includes the wording \" I can firmly state that my Ulysses is more indebted to you than ever was the real Ulysses to the ever @-@ gracious Minerva \" . A 1644 letter from Badoaro to Michelangelo Torcigliani contains the statement \" Il ritorno d 'Ulisse in patria was embellished with the music of Claudio Monteverdi , a man of great fame and enduring name \" . Finally , a 1640 booklet entitled Le Glorie della Musica indicates the Badoaro @-@ Monteverdi pairing as the creators of the opera . In the view of conductor and instrumentalist Sergio Vartolo , these findings establish Monteverdi as the principal composer \" beyond a shadow of a doubt \" . Although parts of the music may be by other hands , there is no doubt that the work is substantially Monteverdi 's and remains close to his original conception ."

Beatty 's ships maintained full speed to try and put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range . They turned north and then northeast to try and rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet . At 5 : 40 they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers . The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5 : 47 . Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it , but he mistimed his maneuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east , further away from the Germans . By 6 : 35 Beatty was following Indomitable and Inflexible of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east @-@ southeast , leading the Grand Fleet , and continuing to engage Hipper 's battlecruisers to their southwest . A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180 ° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze . Twenty minutes later Scheer ordered another 180 ° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet , which had altered course itself to the south . This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer 's T and they badly damaged his leading ships . Scheer ordered yet another 180 ° turn at 7 : 13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap in which he had sent them ."

During the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution , the law of nuisance significantly changed ; rather than the previous tests a standard of care was instead expected , with different standards applying to individuals and companies . In reaching these decisions the courts \" effectively emasculated the Law of Nuisance as a useful curb on industrial pollution \" . In St Helen 's Smelting Co v Tipping , for example , several judges \" were explicit in suggesting that they were affected by the adverse effect of a more draconian view on the economic welfare of the country 's industrial cities \" .

In the 19th century , Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa , making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form of social interaction , expressing the participants ' physical skills and spiritual essence , involving the gods and the spirits of the ancestral fathers . The participants played during festivals and holidays , jumping and leaping in front of musical bands , military troops , and religious processions . This dance “ game ” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century .

Instead , the songbird is capable of living through its song , which is a fate that humans cannot expect .

In the poem , Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead — as a \" sod \" over which the nightingale sings . The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden , is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination .

He appointed William Watt as Speaker of the House , effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches , a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter . But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of what became known as the Coalition – an arrangement of electoral and political cooperation between the Nationalists ( and their successors ) and the Country Party . Although differing greatly in character and background , the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page . Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship , however . As part of the Coalition agreement , the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11 . Page also became Treasurer and ranked second in the Cabinet .

Although his style is painterly , his work is produced for the purpose of mass reproduction , and it is produced with the intent of delivering a common message to its viewers via a detailed narrative style . Furthermore , the vast majority of Rockwell 's work was viewed in reproduced format and almost none of his contemporaneous audience ever saw his original work . Also , Rockwell 's style of backwoods New England small @-@ town realism , known as regionalism , was sometimes viewed as out of step with the oncoming wave of abstract modern art . Some say his realism is so direct that he abstains from using artistic license . John Canaday , a New York Times art critic once referred to Rockwell as the \" Rembrandt of Punkin ' Crick \" for his aversion to the vices of big city life . Dave Hickey derided Rockwell for painting without inflection . Some critics also view his sentimental and nostalgic vision out of step with the harsh realities of American life , such as the Great Depression . Deborah Solomon views the works as being \" based on lofty civic principles \" , but rather than dealing with the warring patriots , they present themes with \" civic and familial rituals \" for \" emblematic scenes \" ."

He was supportive of the extra public money given to public services in the New Labour years but believed it to be under the guise of privatisation . Overall , his concluding judgement on New Labour is highly critical ; he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing the party from the trade union movement , adopting a presidentialist style of politics , overriding the concept of the collective ministerial responsibility by reducing the power of the Cabinet , eliminated any effective influence from the annual conference of the Labour Party and \" hinged its foreign policy on support for one of the worst presidents in US history \" ."

Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter , allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients . Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk . As early as 1924 , environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems , and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species . Over the next 40 years , increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems . In 1963 , a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks . The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems . By 1968 , the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes . The service determined that fires that started naturally ( by lightning ) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property . The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions , controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems . Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn ."

They could also see which wings worked well as they looked through the viewing window in the top of the tunnel . The tests yielded a trove of valuable data never before known and showed that the poor lift of the 1900 and 1901 gliders was entirely due to an incorrect Smeaton value , and that Lilienthal 's published data were fairly accurate for the tests he had done ."

Thus , Pulteney Bridge became not just a means of crossing the river , but also a shopping arcade . Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence , which it resembles , it is one of the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose . It has been substantially altered since it was built . The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney , the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath . The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding , with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses .

In an alternate account , the swordfish positions itself beneath the whale , while the thresher leaps out of the water and lands on top of the whale , hammering it onto the swordfish 's rostrum . Yet other authors describe the thresher \" cutting huge gashes \" in the side of the whale with its tail . Neither threshers nor swordfish however are known to feed on whales or indeed possess the dentition to do so . The story may have arisen from mariners mistaking the tall dorsal fins of killer whales , which do attack large cetaceans , for thresher shark tails .

Baynes ' Constantine the Great and the Christian Church ( 1929 ) and reinforced by Andreas Alföldi 's The Conversion of Constantine and Pagan Rome ( 1948 ) , a historiographic tradition developed which presented Constantine as a committed Christian . T. D. Barnes 's seminal Constantine and Eusebius ( 1981 ) represents the culmination of this trend . Barnes ' Constantine experienced a radical conversion , which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire . Charles Matson Odahl 's recent Constantine and the Christian Empire ( 2004 ) takes much the same tack . In spite of Barnes ' work , arguments over the strength and depth of Constantine 's religious conversion continue . Certain themes in this school reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott 's The Christianity of Constantine the Great ( 1996 ) , which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood . A similar view of Constantine is held in Paul Veyne 's recent ( 2007 ) work , Quand notre monde est devenu chrétien , which does not speculate on the origins of Constantine 's Christian motivation , but presents him , in his role as Emperor , as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed himself meant \" to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity \" ."

The Germans , having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics , now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies . On 21 March 1918 Germany launched a full scale Spring Offensive against the British and French lines , hoping for victory on the battlefield before United States troops arrived in numbers . The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion , and facing defeat London realized it needed more troops to fight a mobile war . Lloyd George found half a million soldiers and rushed them to France , asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help , and agreed to the appointment of the French Marshal Foch as commander in chief on the Western Front , so that Allied forces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive ."

    "text": "Since the early 20th century , controversies have arisen regarding the accuracy of the monument 's placement . After the initial surveys , it was found that the borders did not always exactly follow the lines of meridian and parallel as had been intended . This is due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time . This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel ( and if new , more accurate , surveys needed to be done ) , or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border . This issue was resolved when New Mexico sued Colorado in 1919 , and in 1925 the Supreme Court ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders , even if the markers were off in some locations ( this includes the Four Corners Monument ) . Today 's legal description of these border lines are based on the original markers , and not the written description of the borders created when the territories were formed . Because of this , the borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag . One example is the border between Colorado and Utah , where in one area the border jogs west about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from where it was intended to be placed . Because this error occurred in the original survey — which superseded the written description ( being simply the 32nd meridian west of Washington ) , the border set out by the markers remains the border between the two states .

To separate the Persona series from the Megami Tensei series , the first game 's banner title Megami Ibunroku was dropped . The theme of Innocent Sin , as with the previous entry , was exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves . The central character theme of Innocent Sin was the growth of teenagers and how they overcome their personal troubles . Another key element was the \" power of Kotodama \" , the Japanese belief that words can influence the physical and spiritual world , with this power manifesting in the world of Persona 2 through the spreading of rumors . Terms and concepts used in the games , including Persona , Shadows and the character Philemon , were drawn from Jungian psychology and archetypes . The character of Nyarlathotep , who had made a cameo appearance as a Persona in the original game , was inspired by the character of the same name from H. P. Lovecraft 's Cthulhu Mythos . Other antagonists and enemy creatures in the games were also drawn from the Cthulhu Mythos and played a key role in the narrative ."

Of these cemeteries , only the one dating to the late 3rd Dynasty contains large tombs , of which are four mud brick mastabas . Reisner and Fisher observe that this is to be expected of the necropolis surrounding the pyramid of a pharaoh , the large tombs being those of the royal family and court officials . In particular , around 200 metres ( 660 ft ) north of the layer pyramid is a huge mastaba , today known as Mastaba Z500 , which yielded eight marble bowls inscribed with the serekh of king Khaba . Reisner and Fisher therefore conclude that \" if the mastabas belong to people connected with the king who built the pyramid , it is probable that the king ’ s name was Khaba \" .

The original title song was entitled \" Mr. Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang \" , taken from an Italian journalist who in 1962 dubbed agent 007 as Mr. Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang . The title theme was written by Barry and Leslie Bricusse ; the song was originally recorded by Shirley Bassey , and later rerecorded by Dionne Warwick , whose version was not released until the 1990s . The song was removed from the title credits after producers Albert R.

Barry then teamed up with lyricist Don Black and wrote \" Thunderball \" , which was sung by Tom Jones who , according to Bond production legend , fainted in the recording booth when singing the song 's final note .

In the last years of the war he had envisaged a post @-@ war order based on a continuing alliance of the four powers – the United States , the British Empire , the Soviet Union and China – that could evolve into a new international body with a similar function as the League of Nations , but with a stronger role and authority in international matters . Bruce had rejoined Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr in these years in reviving their proposals for international cooperation on nutrition and agriculture . He wrote and made representations at all levels on the subject , and became a leading voice once more advocating the creation of an international body to examine social and economic questions , much as he had done during his years with the League of Nations . The efforts of McDougall , Bruce and Orr finally paid off when their work came to the attention of Eleanor Roosevelt , and subsequently the American government , and their proposals would find expression at the Food and Agriculture Conference that Franklin Roosevelt convened in Hot Springs , Virginia , in May 1943 . This conference agreed to the establishment of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , which became an associated institution with the United Nations when it was established formally in October 1945 ."

It developed from a tropical disturbance on January 20 south of the Solomon Islands , and at first moved slowly towards the west . On January 25 , the disturbance gained enough strength and organization to be named Beni . It quickly made a clockwise loop , maintaining its intensity , and later headed south . After fluctuating in intensity , Beni entered more conducive conditions and began to strengthen , this time heading southeast . Traveling between Vanuatu and New Caledonia , Beni reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on January 29 , the highest rating on the Australian cyclone scale , with winds of 235 km / h ( 146 mph ) . It only maintained this intensity for a short time before an increase in wind shear and less favorable conditions induced its weakening . After nearing Vanuatu , a strengthening ridge forced Beni towards the southwest , away from Vanuatu . The cyclone made its closest approach to the island of New Caledonia on January 30 , but only as a marginal Category 1 cyclone . Continuing to weaken under strong wind shear , Beni was downgraded to a tropical depression the same day . After crossing New Caledonia , Beni exited the South Pacific basin and entered the Australian region ."

The legates ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court . The historian David Bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal \" seal of approval \" for William 's conquest . The legates and the king then proceeded to hold a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganising the English church . Stigand and his brother , Æthelmær , the Bishop of Elmham , were deposed from their bishoprics . Some of the native abbots were also deposed , both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near Whitsun . The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury , and Thomas of Bayeux as the new Archbishop of York , to replace Ealdred , who had died in September 1069 . William 's half @-@ brother Odo perhaps expected to be appointed to Canterbury , but William probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member . Another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint Lanfranc . Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots , and at the end of the process , only two native English bishops remained in office , along with several continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor . In 1070 William also founded Battle Abbey , a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings , partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to those dead ."

Japan 's Naval General Staff endorsed Inoue 's argument and began planning further operations , using these locations as supporting bases , to seize Nauru , Ocean Island , New Caledonia , Fiji , and Samoa and thereby cut the supply lines between Australia and the U.S. , with the goal of reducing or eliminating Australia as a threat to Japanese positions in the South Pacific ."

More recently , several authors argue that G. indicum should be rejected as a nomen dubium and G. triplex maintained as the correct name for the species ."

Recent major public buildings include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre , Glasgow ( 1997 ) , designed by Norman Foster ( 1935 – ) and known for its segmented , curving roof as \" the Armadillo \" , and the many striking modern buildings along the side of the River Clyde , such as the Glasgow Science Centre , IMAX Cinema and Glasgow Tower ( 2001 ) , which is the highest in Scotland . The most important public building of the early twenty @-@ first century is the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh , designed by Enric Miralles ( 1955 – 2000 ) and opened in 2004 , with a design that recalls upturned fishing boats . There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland 's architectural heritage , including the great buildings and monuments , but also the classically influenced houses of towns like Edinburgh and Glasgow and the surviving tenements , many of which have been renovated , restored from the black fronts created by pollution to their original pink and honeyed sandstone , and brought up to modern standards of accommodation . Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post @-@ industrial decline , like the Merchant City in Glasgow , which was returned to housing from the 1980s , with warehouse loft conversions , and , more recently , the waterfront in Edinburgh , resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres ."

    "text": "Subsequent military science studies of the use of Rangers during the Korean War have focused on analysing their economy of force by looking at how well the U.S. military employed them as special forces . In an analysis of the operations of all Ranger units in the Korean War , Major Chelsea Y. Chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College that they were misused and ineffective in general , and that in particular the Eighth Army Ranger Company had been poorly employed . Chae noted that the Ranger formations ' lack of support personnel made them a logistic and administrative liability , as they had to be attached to conventional units for support . Furthermore , he argued that the Rangers ' small formation sizes meant that they lacked the manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers , and their employment with divisional elements did not provide them with the intelligence information necessary for effective infiltration operations . He concluded that these problems were due to a \" lack of understanding of Ranger capabilities , limitations inherent in Rangers ' force structure , and basic distrust of elite forces . \""

The practice of stretching the lips by piercing them and inserting plates or plugs was found throughout Pre @-@ Columbian Mesoamerica and South America as well as among some of the tribes of the Pacific Northwest and Africa . In some parts of Malawi , it was quite common for women to adorn their lips with a lip disc called a \" pelele \" that by means of gradual enlargement from childhood could reach several inches of diameter and would eventually alter the occlusion of the jaw . Such lip stretching is still practiced in some places . Women of the Mursi of Ethiopia wear lip rings on occasion that may reach 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter ."

Incomplete crafting \" kits \" to create original reborns can also be purchased from various online stores . There is a large price range depending on the quality of the doll , but they can sell anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars . There are many factors to look for when purchasing a reborn . If the complexion is too dark this is called a blue baby , and indicates it was dyed excessively or uses colored sand for weight that could have seeped into the vinyl . The type of material used to weight the reborn should be considered because some materials do not react well with vinyl and will cause it to deteriorate . The doll should not be shiny . This indicates the doll was washed with acetone before painting , which prevents the color from correctly sticking to the doll 's surface . It may also be caused by the type of paint used to color the doll . This is corrected with a heat set matte varnish . The parts used are important , as original parts may be replaced . The replacement parts must be appropriately proportioned with the doll and made of quality material . At times having the original body retains the doll 's value either because it was made to fit that specific doll , or the artist left a signature mark . Eye brand , size , fitting , and alignment should be closely examined . Another feature to observe is the type of paint used for coloring and whether the doll is realistic in its details such as veins and newborn imperfections . The material and technique used in applying the hair may determine the quality . The nose should be open with the holes correctly shaped , and the nails should be properly manicured ."

In the Savoy operas , there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key ( less than 5 % of the musical numbers ) , and even in his serious works the major prevails . Examples of Sullivan 's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony , \" Go away , madam \" in the Act I finale of Iolanthe ( echoing Verdi and Beethoven ) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard . Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect . When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box , he replied \" if 5ths turn up it doesn 't matter , so long as there is no offence to the ear . \" Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan 's characteristic modulation between keys , as in \" Expressive glances \" ( Princess Ida ) , where he smoothly negotiates E major , C sharp minor and C major , or \" Then one of us will be a queen \" ( The Gondoliers ) , where he writes in F major , D flat major and D minor ."

The storm was the first hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico to form in the month of July since 1959 , and was the fifth tropical cyclone to form during the annual hurricane season . Though the origin of Bob can be traced back to a tropical wave near the western coast of Africa in late June , Bob formed from a tropical depression in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on July 9 . Tracking in a general northward direction , favorable conditions allowed for quick strengthening . Less than a day after formation , the system reached tropical storm intensity , followed by hurricane intensity on July 11 . Shortly after strengthening into a hurricane , Bob reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 12 inHg ) .

Unfortunately , the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting : there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle . Hence , π2 ( S1 ) = 0 . This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible ( it has the homotopy type of a point ) . In addition , because S2 is simply connected , by the lifting criterion , any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space ."

For photons , this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas , for material particles ( electron ) , this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation . Although this similarity might suggest that Maxwell 's equations describing the photon 's electromagnetic wave are simply Schrödinger 's equation for photons , most physicists do not agree . For one thing , they are mathematically different ; most obviously , Schrödinger 's one equation for the electron solves for a complex field , whereas Maxwell 's four equations solve for real fields . More generally , the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function cannot be applied to photons . As photons are massless , they cannot be localized without being destroyed ; technically , photons cannot have a position eigenstate <formula> , and , thus , the normal Heisenberg uncertainty principle <formula> does not pertain to photons . A few substitute wave functions have been suggested for the photon , but they have not come into general use .

However , Stabiae was 16 km from the vent ( roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated ) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the fumes , and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause , such as a stroke or heart attack .

Another skirmish took place at Bonchurch several days after the battle , when English forces engaged with French men who had disembarked from French ships retreating from Portsmouth looking for water . A senior French commander , Chevalier D 'Aux , was killed as a result of the engagement . The English victory at Bonchurch only had a marginal impact on the course of the Italian War of 1542 @-@ 1546 , because the battle only involved a very small number of men relative to the numbers of men that were engaged throughout the entirety of the war . The fact that it only had a marginal impact is also because , if the French had captured the Isle of Wight , it is unlikely that that capture would have drastically affected the course of the war , because there were more significant territories that were being contested . The Isle of Wight could have been used to support French operations against England had it been captured ; Claude d 'Annebault , commander of the French armada , recorded that “ having it [ the Isle of Wight ] under our control , we [ the French ] could then dominate Portsmouth ... and so put the enemy to extraordinary expense in maintaining a standing army and navy to contain us . ” Although some sources do state that the victory at Bonchurch was responsible for the French withdrawal from the Isle of Wight , the source of information which states that the French won the battle says that fighting at Bembridge was what drove the French from the island ."

The home range , in which the bird actually hunts for food , varies with the type of habitat and time of year . If a male intrudes into the territory of another , the occupier approaches and emits its territorial calls . If the intruder persists , the occupier flies at him aggressively .

The territory is more actively defended against a strange male as compared to a known male from a neighbouring territory ; it has been shown that the little owl can recognise familiar birds by voice ."

Here the process was formalized into a rankings system obsessed over by its players . The femme fatale — a noir staple — Misako , does not simply entice the protagonist and bring the threat of death but obsesses him and is obsessed with all things death herself . She tries to kill him , wants to kill herself and surrounds herself with dead things . Hanada 's libido is as present as that of the protagonists of similar films of the period , such as James Bond , though perversely exaggerated . Reviewer Rumsey Taylor likened Hanada 's boiled rice sniffing fetish to Bond 's \" shaken , not stirred \" martini order .

They support this reading of the 14th amendment by noting that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 did not ban segregated schools and that the same Congress that passed the 14th Amendment also voted to segregate schools in the District of Columbia . Other originalists , including Michael W.

By day they would record the details of all vehicles and troop movements , and at night they would move to about 30 yards ( 27 m ) from the road and guess what type of vehicles were passing by their sound and outline . At daylight they were relieved by another pair of men who took over that day 's road watch . If tanks or a large number of troops were seen passing they would radio the LRDG headquarters at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line , GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming . Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa . The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch , but they did have some close encounters .

While the road watch was ongoing , other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road , by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire .

    "text": "In 483 BC , a vast new seam of silver was found in the Athenian mines at Laurium . Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of triremes , ostensibly to assist in a long running war with Aegina . Plutarch suggests that Themistocles deliberately avoided mentioning Persia , believing that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on , but that countering Persia was the fleet 's aim . Fine suggests that many Athenians must have admitted that such a fleet would be needed to resist the Persians , whose preparations for the coming campaign were known . Themistocles 's motion was passed easily , despite strong opposition from Aristides . Its passage was probably due to the desire of many of the poorer Athenians for paid employment as rowers in the fleet . It is unclear from the ancient sources whether 100 or 200 ships were initially authorised ; both Fine and Holland suggest that at first 100 ships were authorised and that a second vote increased this number to the levels seen during the second invasion . Aristides continued to oppose Themistocles 's policy , and tension between the two camps built over the winter , so the ostracism of 482 BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides . In what Holland characterises as , in essence , the world 's first referendum , Aristides was ostracised , and Themistocles 's policies were endorsed . Indeed , becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion , the Athenians voted to build more ships than those for which Themistocles had asked . Thus , during the preparations for the Persian invasion , Themistocles had become the leading politician in Athens ."

It is in the way that Facundo articulates this opposition that Sarmiento 's book has had such a profound influence . In the words of González Echevarría : \" in proposing the dialectic between civilization and barbarism as the central conflict in Latin American culture Facundo gave shape to a polemic that began in the colonial period and continues to the present day \" ."

However , once there , they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large , thus the Greeks retreated . Shortly afterwards , they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont . At this point , a second strategy was suggested by Themistocles to the allies . The route to southern Greece ( Boeotia , Attica and the Peloponnesus ) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the narrow pass of Thermopylae . This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites , despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians .

With the help from Brezhnev Podgorny managed to make the Council of Ministers subordinate to the Presidium . However , these changes threatened Brezhnev , and Brezhnev would later order Konstantin Chernenko to take a look at the 1936 Soviet Constitution to find a way to weaken Podgorny 's position . As it turned out there were none , Podgorny 's position as head of state meant that he could in fact block any measures taken by Brezhnev to circumscribe his powers . Chernenko did come up with a solution , to make it law that the Party leader would also become the leader of the Government apparatus . The 1977 Soviet Constitution was drafted to weaken the position of Podgorny by making it law that the Party leader was in fact also leader of the Government . The draft which dealt with the leading role of the Party , and its clear supremacy , in Soviet society was approved by the Soviet leadership .

The actress and the shows writers worked closely with the MS Society to make the storyline as realistic as possible and it was praised by both the society and viewers who have the condition . Jenna Litchfield of the MS Society said soap opera storylines in which characters are diagnosed with MS helped to highlight the condition and its effects . She added that the storyline had \" sparked interest . \" Of the storyine , Woodburne stated \" It 's a massive story and to take a character that has always been so strong and to challenge them physically and emotionally was terrific . I know that the writing department did an enormous amount of research . \" Woodburne also explained that as Susan is such a strong person mentally , she goes through an emotional struggle when her body lets her down . Woodburne commented that she found the scenes distressing to play as she is so attached to her character . She told a writer for Inside Soap that it was a difficult storyline , but \" ultimately rewarding \" . On screen , Susan learnt how to keep her symptoms under control and Woodburne said she would occasionally have a relapse , as the condition does not go away . In 2011 , Woodburne commented on the MS storyline , which she enjoyed , saying it was very challenging to tell a good story and make it authentic and real for people who have the condition ."

    "text": "Extratropical cyclones form along linear bands of temperature / dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear , and are thus classified as baroclinic cyclones . Initially , cyclogenesis , or low pressure formation , occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak . The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants , where divergence ensues . The divergence causes air to rush out from the top of the air column . This in turn forces convergence in the low @-@ level wind field and increased upward motion within the column . The increased upward motion causes atmospheric pressure at ground level to lower . This is because the upward air motion counteracts gravity , lessening the weight of the atmosphere in that location . The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone ( a low pressure system ) . As the cyclone strengthens , the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone . Meanwhile , its associated warm front progresses more slowly , as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser , and therefore more difficult to dislodge . Later , the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front , forcing a tongue , or trowal , of warm air aloft . Eventually , the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken ."

On a matting pitch , unfamiliar to the Australians , Johnson 's team lost the inaugural Test against Pakistan at Karachi . Responding to the loss , a cartoon drawn by Norman Mitchell of the Adelaide News newspaper suggested island planters might be able to scrape together a team that would be a match for the Australians . Returning to turf pitches in India , the Australians restored some pride . Johnson was the highest scorer in the Australian team 's victory by an innings and five runs in the First Test at Nehru Stadium in Madras . Due to injury , both Johnson and Miller missed the drawn Second Test at Brabourne Stadium at Bombay ; Lindwall skippered the side . Johnson returned for the Third Test at Eden Gardens , Calcutta for what would ultimately prove to be his final Test . The Australians won the match by 94 runs , giving them a 2 – 0 series win . S. K.

    "text": "Many endemic Mascarene birds , including the dodo , are descended from South Asian ancestors , and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may also be the case for all parrots there . Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene , so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands . Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known , subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws , reduced pectoral bones , and robust leg bones . Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe , members of which are known as Psittaculines , basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean . The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times , as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea . Other members of the Psittacula genus from the Mascarenes include the extant echo parakeet ( Psittacula eques echo ) of Mauritius , as well as the extinct Réunion parakeet ( Psittacula eques eques ) , and Mascarene grey parakeet ( Psittacula bensoni ) of both Mauritius and Réunion ."

In some cases , supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental , a result of group members fishing individually in close proximity ; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter , such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman . The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water . Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous , with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets . The otter can attack from both above and below , swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws . Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately ; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head . Carter and Rosas have found captive adult animals consume around 10 % of their body weight daily — about 3 kilograms ( 7 lb ) , in keeping with findings in the wild ."

The mutualistic association between tree roots and the mycelium of the fungus helps the trees extract nutrients ( particularly phosphorus ) from the earth ; in exchange , the fungus receives carbohydrates from photosynthesis . In North America , associations with oak and pine are usual , while in India , it has been noted to grow commonly with chir pine ( Pinus roxburghii ) and sal ( Shorea robusta ) . The false earthstar is found on the ground in open fields , often scattered or in groups , especially in nutrient @-@ poor , sandy or loamy soils .

More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the Iron Age . Elaborately carved Pictish stones and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages . The development of a common style of Insular art across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells . Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin . The influence of the Renaissance can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century . In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty . The Reformation removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display , but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms , particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls . Although the loss of the court as a result of the Union of Crowns in 1603 removed another major source of patronage , the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant , with figures such as George Jamesone and John Michael Wright ."

He wanted to design a Mega Man different from the original one . However , Inafune realized afterwards that the character he created was too different from Mega Man 's old appearance to be viewed positively by fans . Deciding to let another designer work on the character that eventually became Mega Man X while he developed Zero , Inafune created the character intending him to be \" the ' other main character ' that would \" steal all the good scenes \" . He further described Zero as representing the idea that \" nothing is absolute \" , and circumstances can change anything . When asked if Zero had killed the cast of the original Mega Man titles , suspected due to their absence in the X series , he replied no , adding that given how he had designed the character , \" Zero is not such a person--it is not in his profile . \""

As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879 , \" The construction of battleships is so costly , their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration , that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people \" . The Jeune École school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet . It proposed what would nowadays be termed a sea denial strategy , based on fast , long @-@ ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports . The ideas of the Jeune Ecole were ahead of their time ; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines , torpedoes , submarines , and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented . The determination of powers such as Germany to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians , who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet that has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle ."

    "text": "In efficiency wage models , workers are paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market . For example , in developing countries , firms might pay more than a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive . Firms might also pay higher wages to increase loyalty and morale , possibly leading to better productivity . Firms can also pay higher than market wages to forestall shirking . Shirking models were particularly influential . Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz ( 1984 ) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment . If the economy is at full employment , a fired shirker simply moves to a new job . Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having to move to a new job . Since each firm pays more than market clearing wages , the aggregated labor market fails to clear . This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired . Workers not only risk a lower wage , they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed . Keeping wages above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed ."

However , the 49 needed to be used with the new 72 @-@ type tyres , causing the car to be unstable . Seemingly unaffected by this , Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called \" the race of his life \" . From eighth on the grid , he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for lack of overtaking opportunities . In the closing stages , he was second , steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham . On the very last lap , at Gasometer hairpin , the final corner of the circuit , Brabham made a mistake : he braked too late , touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the straw balls , allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season . Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the Belgian Grand Prix , a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had several metre gaps in between them . He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72 , but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone , forcing Rindt to switch cars once more . Even with engine troubles during the rest of practice , he still managed to qualify on the front row , but later retired with another engine failure ."

Both early and late datings were based on the \" archaic \" treatment of space .

Wood used for panel paintings during this period customarily underwent a lengthy period of storage for seasoning purposes , so the age of the oak might be expected to predate the actual date of the painting by several years . Internal evidence , specifically the depiction of a pineapple ( a \" New World \" fruit ) , suggests that the painting itself postdates Columbus ' voyages to the Americas , between 1492 and 1504 . The dendrochronological research brought Vermet to reconsider an early dating and , consequently , to dispute the presence of any \" New World \" objects , stressing the presence of African ones instead .

The survivors , veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs , songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism , calling it variously \" the phenomenon \" , \" the pride \" , \" the hell \" and \" the Croatian knight \" . Writers appealed to the \" Vukovar principle \" , the \" spirituality of Vukovar \" and \" Vukovar ethics \" , the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople . Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar . In 1994 , when Croatia replaced the Croatian dinar with its new currency , the kuna , it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the Vučedol Dove – an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia , which was discovered near Vukovar – on the new 20 @-@ kuna note .

Strong contrasts which disrupt outlines are better suited for environments such as forests where the play of light and shade is prominent , while low contrasts are better suited to open terrain with little shading structure . Patterns made to match the local terrain may be more effective in that terrain than more general patterns . However , unlike an animal or a civilian hunter , military units may need to cross several terrain types like woodland , farmland and built up areas in a single day . While civilian hunting clothing may have almost photo @-@ realistic depictions of tree bark or leaves ( indeed , some such patterns are based on photographs ) , military camouflage is designed to work in a range of environments .

It was purchased by the lord of a local manor , who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation . At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis , that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct , the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth . Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers , starting in 1814 , describing it for the Royal Society . The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil , and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock 's museum . Perplexed by the creature , Home kept changing his mind about its classification , first thinking it was a kind of fish , then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck @-@ billed platypus ( only recently known to science ) ; finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards , which led him to propose naming it Proteo @-@ Saurus . By then Charles Konig , an assistant curator of the British Museum , had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus ( fish lizard ) for the specimen and that name stuck .

He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering \" too feeble \" a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals ( Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte ) . This resulted in the Journal removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages .

Senator Bob Dole , then head of the Republican Party , sharply denounced Time Warner after a meeting between Michael J. Fuchs ( head of the Warner Music Group ) , William Bennett , and C. Delores Tucker , at which Tucker and Bennett demanded that Fuchs recite lyrics from \" Big Man with a Gun \" because they thought the song was an attack on American conservatives by metaphorically claiming within the lyrics that they have a jingoistic agenda . Interscope was blamed for releasing gangster rap albums by Dr. Dre , Tupac Shakur , and Snoop Dogg that were deemed objectionable . Reznor called Tucker ( who referred to Nine Inch Nails as a gangster rap act ) \" such a fucking idiot \" and claimed \" Big Man with a Gun \" was a satire of the genre and was originally about madness . Reznor conceded The Downward Spiral could be \" harmful , through implying and subliminally suggesting things , \" whereas hardcore hip hop can be \" cartoonish . \" Robert Bork also repeatedly referenced \" Big Man with a Gun \" in his book Slouching Toward Gomorrah as evidence of a cultural decline .

    "text": "The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas . For example , Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation . Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism . In the 20th century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces ( all except gravity ) are manifestations of matter ( fermions ) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons . This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation . The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism , but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete . A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics . Physicists are still attempting to develop self @-@ consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything .

The discovery of a bloody tooth in the fireplace leads Sam to suspect that an evil version of Santa — many world lores tell of those who punish the wicked during Christmas — is at work . As the brothers search the town and debate about whether to celebrate Christmas that year — Dean insists while Sam refuses — another man is taken by a Santa @-@ dressed being . Upon investigation the following day , Sam notices that both families have the same wreath over their fireplaces . The wreath is found to be made of meadowsweet , an herb often used in pagan rituals to lure gods to a human sacrifice , which leads Sam to believe that they are dealing with Hold Nickar , the god of the winter solstice . Dean later admits that he wants to celebrate Christmas since it will be his last chance to — his demonic pact with a demon in \" All Hell Breaks Loose , Part Two \" only left him with one year to live . Sam responds that he cannot sit around celebrating and pretending that everything is okay while knowing that Dean will not be alive the next Christmas ."

According to Volker Walther and colleagues , the development can be divided into two phases : in the first , the primordium is established that contains all the structures of the mature fruit body ; in the second stage , the primordial stipe elongates rapidly , and the newly exposed hymenium immediately begins spore production . The first detected stage of fruit body formation was an irregularly arranged hyphal structure within the colonized substrate . After rupturing the surface of the substrate and establishing itself there , the structure develops a layer of wrapping hyphae that covers the entire primordium . The structures of the stipe and the cap develop simultaneously . The developing stipe , cap , and basal disc together form a secondary ring @-@ like cavity , in which the gills develop . Gill development initiates with a number of small alveolae on the lower side of the cap , which are covered with a hymenophoral palisade ( a group of tightly packed , roughly parallel cells ) . The margins of these alveolae form the primary gills . The hymenophoral palisade spreads from the developing alveolae to the gill edge ; the edge of the primary gills is forked in the early stages of its development . The secondary gills ( lamellulae ) are formed by the ridges folding down from the lower side of the cap .

Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty 's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet , most notably Paul Taglioni ( son of Filippo Taglioni ) , who staged ballets including Coralia , ou Le Chevalier inconstant ( 1847 ) and Electra ( 1849 , the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting ) . Arthur Saint @-@ Léon staged such works as La Vivandière ( 1844 ) , Le Violin du Diable ( 1849 ) , and Le Jugement de Pâris ( 1850 ) , which was considered a sequel of sorts to Pas de Quatre ."

The result of a series of towing tests begun in 1910 , this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent , supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull . At speeds of more than 25 knots , test results were highly favorable . A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the outer plating of the forecastle at higher speeds . However , this tendency could be reduced to some degree by careful design of the frames .

To activate the technique , the user releases the seal to forcibly release the stored chakra to the body . Through the input of the user , proteins hasten the creation of new cells through cell division , which regenerates any injuries sustained by the user . Thus , as long as the user have enough chakra , they are able to regenerate even the most fatal injuries , essentially making them \" invincible \" in combat . However , because body cells can only divide a number of times in life , the user is basically shortening their own lifespan by speeding up the process . Tsunade manages to counteract this to a certain extent through her long lifespan , thus she is able to live even after using the jutsu several times . The jutsu also has a variation , Mitotic Regeneration : One Hundred Healings ( 百豪の術 , Byakugō no Jutsu , lit . \" Strength of a Hundred Technique \" ) . Though it has the same effect as the original , the user does not need to input chakra to activate , thus injuries are automatically regenerated as the damages are done . Tsunade , for the longest time the only ninja who had mastered this technique , had made the rule that prohibits any medical ninja to directly participate in battles if they had not mastered this technique . Tsunade 's student , Sakura Haruno , is also able to use One Hundred Healings after having stored her chakra for three years to form the Byakugo Seal ."

Lancashire had a particularly poor reputation among other county teams for using bowlers who threw : by the early 1880s , up to four of Lancashire 's main bowlers were judged to be unfair , including John Crossland who bowled very quickly . By the mid @-@ 1880s , several teams refused to play Lancashire on account of their bowling attack . Mainly through the actions of Lord Harris , many of the suspect bowlers were forced out of cricket , and bowling actions became more legitimate . However , some players continued to bowl with questionable actions , including members of the Lancashire team . The issue intensified in 1896 when two of the Australian touring team , Ernie Jones and Tom McKibbin , seemed to throw the ball regularly ; Sydney Pardon , the editor of Wisden , wrote : \" The mortifying fact was that the illegal bowling was due entirely to our own weakness in not having the laws of the game carried out .

Her boss , Bill Covington , arranged for Johnson to exhibit 135 of his paintings for a single afternoon , on April 15 , 1930 . Although the Florence Morning News described Johnson condescendingly as a \" humble ... Negro youth \" , it also admitted that he had \" real genius \" ."

The Labour group 's official policy was to delay the sale for several years , so that the empty workhouse buildings could be used as temporary housing during slum clearance and rebuilding . The issue split Labour on religious lines ; nearly all the Catholic members of the Labour group defied party policy and voted for an immediate sale . Among the rebels was the sitting St Anne 's councillor , Olive Hughes . She was thereupon deselected by the St Anne 's ward , which chose Bessie as their candidate for the 1930 election . Bessie faced a difficult task , since Hughes chose to stand against her as an Independent Socialist , with the support of leading local Catholics in a ward where the electorate was 85 per cent Catholic .

While the squadron was unable to conduct any operations for several weeks after this attack , the damaged aircraft were subsequently repaired . In March No. 6 Squadron participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea by searching for barges and attacking lifeboats carrying survivors from the Japanese ships which had been sunk . Due to the unit 's high rate of flying activities , No. 6 Squadron 's Hudsons increasingly suffered from mechanical problems , and this may have contributed to a drop in the number of hours flown by the squadron from March 1943 .

Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452 – 1519 ) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s . Leonardo 's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids . These , such as the rhombicuboctahedron , were among the first to be drawn to demonstrate perspective by being overlaid on top of each other . The work discusses perspective in the works of Piero della Francesca , Melozzo da Forlì , and Marco Palmezzano . Da Vinci studied Pacioli 's Summa , from which he copied tables of proportions . In Mona Lisa and The Last Supper , Da Vinci 's work incorporated linear perspective with a vanishing point to provide apparent depth .

When Scott began directing the film , he also sought to make it realistic and received help from James L. Green , the Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA 's Science Mission Directorate . Green put together teams to answer scientific questions that Scott asked . Green said , \" The Martian is reasonably realistic \" , though he said the film 's hazardous dust storm , despite reaching speeds of 120 miles per hour ( 190 km / h ) would in reality have weak force . Green also found the NASA buildings in the film to be more stylish than the functional ones NASA actually uses . Film critics picked up the point that the Martian winds could amount to \" barely a light breeze \" in their reviews , and screenwriter Goddard agreed the winds had to be considerably exaggerated in order to set up the situation that sets the story in motion ."

His elevation , however , led to accusatory rumours from King James 's supporters that Marlborough had disgracefully betrayed his erstwhile king for personal gain ; William himself entertained reservations about the man who had deserted James . Marlborough 's apologists though , including his most notable descendant and biographer Winston Churchill , have been at pains to attribute patriotic , religious , and moral motives to his action ; but in the words of Chandler , it is difficult to absolve Marlborough of ruthlessness , ingratitude , intrigue and treachery against a man to whom he owed virtually everything in his life and career to date ."

After twelve years of peace , Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more , taking control of Norway , Denmark and Gaul . Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered , and Arthur 's victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome 's . Arthur and his warriors , including Kaius ( Kay ) , Beduerus ( Bedivere ) and Gualguanus ( Gawain ) , defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but , as he prepares to march on Rome , Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus ( Mordred ) — whom he had left in charge of Britain — has married his wife Guenhuuara ( Guinevere ) and seized the throne . Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall , but he is mortally wounded .

Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri . McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani : \" Giermani ... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator ... the detective / writer and the writer / detective each belittles his other half , as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away . \" McDonagh also observes that , in what is arguably the film 's most potent shock , Neal at one point really does make Giermani \" go away \" , virtually replacing him on screen \" in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous . \" Earlier , Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience 's surprise – was not Anne , but Altieri . Tenebrae itself is split almost exactly into two parts . The first half belongs to the murders of Berti ; the second to those of Neal . The two are set up as mirrors of one another .

For instance , K20 , the US 's primary standard , originally had an official mass of 1 kg − 39 micrograms ( μg ) in 1889 ; that is to say , K20 was 39 µg less than the IPK . A verification performed in 1948 showed a mass of 1 kg − 19 µg . The latest verification performed in 1989 shows a mass precisely identical to its original 1889 value . Quite unlike transient variations such as this , the US 's check standard , K4 , has persistently declined in mass relative to the IPK — and for an identifiable reason . Check standards are used much more often than primary standards and are prone to scratches and other wear .

Many historical sites have been excavated in Tamil Nadu and Kerala , many of them in the second half of the 20th century . One of the most important archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu is Arikamedu , located 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) south of Pondicherry . According to Wheeler , it was an Indo @-@ Roman trading station that flourished during the first two centuries CE . It has been suggested that Arikamedu was first established as a settlement c . 250 BCE and lasted until 200 CE . Kodumanal and Perur , villages on the banks of the Noyyal river in Coimbatore district , were situated on the ancient trade route between Karur and the west coast , across the Palghat gap on the Western Ghats . Both sites have yielded remains belonging to the Sangam age . Kaveripumpattinam , also known as Puhar or Poompuhar , is located near the Kaveri delta and played a vital role in the brisk maritime history of ancient Tamilakam . Excavations have been carried out both on @-@ shore and off @-@ shore at Puhar and the findings have brought to light the historicity of the region . The artefacts excavated date between 300 BCE and early centuries CE . Some of the off @-@ shore findings indicate that parts of the ancient city may have submerged under the advancing sea , as alluded to by the Sangam literature . Korkai , a port of the early Pandyas at the Tamraparani basin , is now located 7 km inland due to the retreating shoreline caused by sediment deposition . Alagankulam , near the Vaigai delta , was another port city of the Pandyas and an archaeological site that has been excavated in the recent years . Both the Pandyan ports have provided clues about local occupations , such as pearl fishing . Other sites that have yielded remnants from the Sangam age include Kanchipuram , Kunnattur , Malayampattu and Vasavasamudram along the Palar river ; Sengamedu and Karaikadu along the Pennar river ; Perur , Tirukkampuliyur , Alagarai and Urayur along the Kaveri river . These excavations have yielded different varieties of ceramics such as black and red ware , rouletted ware and Russet coated ware , both locally made and imported kinds . Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil @-@ Brahmi inscriptions on them , which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them . Other artifacts such as brick walls , ring wells , pits , industrial items , remains of seeds and shells provide clues about the nature of the settlements and the other aspects of life during the Sangam age .

Most of the men buried in the cemetery were Allied servicemen killed in the Battle of Arnhem , an Allied attempt to cross the Rhine in 1944 , or in the liberation of the city the following year . Men killed in these battles are still discovered in the surrounding area even in the 21st century , and so the number of people interred in the cemetery continues to grow ."

It lived in the Callovian ( Middle to Late Jurassic Period ) of England ( about 165 to 161 million years ago [ mya ] ) . Cetiosauriscus was a quadrupedal , herbivorous , saurischian , and was possibly the earliest diplodocid . It was named by Friedrich von Huene in 1927 , for the species Cetiosaurus leedsi . Before 1993 it was shown that C. leedsi was not a Cetiosauriscus species , so that year Alan J. Charig sent a petition to the ICZN to designate C. stewarti as the type species . The remains include a series of vertebra , a hind leg , a partial sacrum , and a front leg . A potential additional specimen includes a diplodocid whiplash tail . Cetiosauriscus has , over time , been classified in Cetiosauridae , Diplodocidae , and Mamenchisauridae . It lived alongside Sarcolestes , Callovosaurus , and Lexovisaurus ."

The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles , independent of the question of how it can be measured , is called the \" plasma potential \" , or the \" space potential \" . If an electrode is inserted into a plasma , its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a Debye sheath . The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small . This results in the important concept of \" quasineutrality \" , which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma ( <formula> ) , but on the scale of the Debye length there can be charge imbalance . In the special case that double layers are formed , the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths ."

This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies , and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for the way in which they were able to maintain a supply network in the face of a massive bombing campaign . However , the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this , and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads ' advantage . North Korean forces , though initially successful , were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense , and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own . This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake ; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive , and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements , reducing their ability to fight effectively . North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon . This landing , coming behind North Korean lines , had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September ."

The colouration of the flows was found to be similar to its various allotropes . Differences in the lava colour and brightness are a function of the temperature of polyatomic sulfur and the packing and bonding of its atoms . An analysis of the flows that radiate out from Ra Patera revealed differently colored materials , all associated with liquid sulfur , at different distances from the vent : dark albedo material close to the vent at 525 K ( 252 ° C ; 485 ° F ) , red material in the central part of each flow at 450 K ( 177 ° C ; 350 ° F ) , and orange material at the farthest ends of each flow at 425 K ( 152 ° C ; 305 ° F ) . This colour pattern corresponds to flows radiating out from a central vent , cooling as the lava travels away from it . In addition , temperature measurements of thermal emission at Loki Patera taken by Voyager 1 's Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer and Radiometer ( IRIS ) instrument were consistent with sulfur volcanism . However , the IRIS instrument was not capable of detecting wavelengths that are indicative of higher temperatures . This meant that temperatures consistent with silicate volcanism were not discovered by Voyager . Despite this , Voyager scientists deduced that silicates must play a role in Io 's youthful appearance , from its high density and the need for silicates to support the steep slopes along patera walls . The contradiction between the structural evidence and the spectral and temperature data following the Voyager flybys led to a debate in the planetary science community regarding the composition of Io 's lava flows , whether they were composed of silicate or sulfurous materials ."

Despite these advantages , renal ultrasonography in 2009 was not considered a substitute for noncontrast helical CT scan in the initial diagnostic evaluation of urolithiasis .

It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick ( the \" elephant man \" ) . However , Jackson stated the story is untrue in both an interview with Oprah and an interview with Martin Bashir in Take Two - The Footage You Were Never Meant To See . Still , these stories inspired the pejorative nickname \" Wacko Jacko \" , which Jackson acquired the following year and would come to despise . He stopped leaking untruths to the press , so the media began making up their own stories ."

    "text": "However , Rome 's social classes were qualified rather than created by the census . It is perhaps more accurate to say therefore that the army 's structure was slightly refined during this period rather than radically reformed . Prior to these reforms , the infantry was divided into the classis of rich citizens and the infra classem of poorer citizens . The latter were excluded from the regular line of battle on the basis that their equipment was of poor quality . During the reforms , this crude division of poorer and richer citizens was further stratified . The army thereafter consisted of a number of troop types based upon the social class of propertied citizens , collectively known as adsidui . From the poorest in the \" fifth class \" to the richest in the \" first class \" and the equestrians above them , military service was compulsory for all . However , Roman citizens at this time generally viewed military service as a proper undertaking of duty to the state , in contrast to later views of military service as an unwelcome and unpleasant burden . Whereas there are accounts of Romans in the late empire mutilating their own bodies in order to exempt themselves from military service , there seems to have been no such reluctance to serve in the military of early Rome . This may in part be due to the generally lower intensity of conflict in this era ; to the fact that men were fighting close to and often in protection of their own homes , or due to — as posited by later Roman writers — a greater martial spirit in antiquity ."

Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there . Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement . He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \" precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me — and I feel a great weakness for you \" . Tchaikovsky was too self @-@ critical not to see the truth behind these comments . He accepted Balakirev 's criticism , and the two continued to correspond . Tchaikovsky would later destroy the score of Fatum . ( The score would be reconstructed posthumously by using the orchestral parts . )"

He complained about the reception La Tosca had received in Italy , particularly in Milan , and also warned that other composers were interested in the piece . Nonetheless , Ricordi reached terms with Sardou , and assigned the librettist Luigi Illica to write a scenario for an adaptation . In 1891 Illica advised Puccini against the project , most likely because he felt the play could not be successfully adapted to a musical form . When Sardou expressed his unease at entrusting his most successful work to a relatively new composer whose music he did not like , Puccini took offence .
