The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 AD as the dominant power in the Deccan . After a century of struggle for autonomy , the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes , the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur . In the late 10th century , north of Tungabhadra river , the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river . The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region ."

    "text": "The main problem encountered in deciphering the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6 RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50 RJ . The precise mechanism of this process is not known , but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability . The process is similar to the Rayleigh @-@ Taylor instability in hydrodynamics . In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere , centrifugal force plays the role of gravity ; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian ( i.e. pertaining to Io ) plasma , and the light liquid is the hot , much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere . The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma . The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet , while pushing the heavy tubes , filled with the Ionian plasma , away from Jupiter . This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence ."

Subsequently , dry air became entrained in the circulation , and Olivia began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters . The eye became disorganized and eventually dissipated .

About 24 hours later , Olivia weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula . Most of the thunderstorm activity dissipated by the time the depression moved ashore on September 30 ; the next day , Olivia dissipated near the border of Baja California and Baja California Sur ."

Most of the bridges over the navigation were owned by the navigation , and their condition deteriorated . The manager , Mr Bulpett , was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879 . He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent , and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council . The Board carried out temporary repairs , when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened . The following year , Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge , but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income , and could not be sold , and so the county would have to maintain the bridges ."

She addresses her readers as English citizens , arguing that they in particular \" ought to sympathise in [ the Italians ' ] struggles ; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England \" . On a general level , she articulates an \" opposition to monarchical government , disapproval of class distinction , abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties \" similar to that in her historical novels Valperga ( 1823 ) and Perkin Warbeck ( 1830 ) . The central theme of the second journey is \" the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism , and the abuses of papal and priestly authority \" . The solution to Italy 's problems , according to Shelley , is neither \" subjugation \" nor \" revolution \" but rather \" peaceful mediation \" . Ultimately , it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important , which is why she compares the past and present . Rambles articulates the \" Whiggish ideology of political gradualism \" , and is similar to Wollstonecraft 's Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) in that it argues that \" a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations \" ."

It states : \" Thelma is a simple Norwegian maiden living alone with her father in the land of the midnight sun . Her father is one of the few remaining Vikings , famous in history . As such he is held in great reverence by his servants , who consider him somewhat in the nature of a king , and his daughter a princess . Outside of the years spent at school , Thelma has spent nearly all her time alone , her mother having died when she was a baby . When on a visit to her mother 's grave , Thelma meets Sir Philip Errington , a distinguished young Englishman , who is touring Norway in his private yacht . Sir Philip is instantly attracted to her and , obtaining information as to where she lives , presents himself to Olaf , the Viking , and is finally admitted to his friendship and that of his daughter . Sir Phillip woos and wins the fair Thelma for his bride , and with her sails back to England . In London , Thelma at once creates a favorable impression and is cordially welcomed by all of Sir Philip 's friends , who comprise the nobility and aristocracy of the metropolis . Lady Clara , alone , of all Sir Philip 's old friends , wishes Thelma harm . She has long felt an affection for Sir Phillip , and resents the fact that he spurned her love and chose his bride in far @-@ off Norway . This wicked and designing woman determines to wreck Thelma 's happiness , and force her to leave England . This she contrives to do , in making Thelma believe that Sir Philip no longer loves her , but that in truth his heart belongs to Lady Clara . As proof of her statement she shows Thelma a letter written to her by Sir Philip in which he pleads the cause of his friend , who is in love with Lady Clara , and wishes her to become his wife . This Lady Clara claims is a love letter written by Sir Philip to her . Thelma , heartbroken , believing she has lost her husband 's love , returns to Norway , just as her father , the Viking , breathes his last . She , with his faithful followers , complies with his last wishes , which are that he shall be buried as his forefathers were before him – sent out to sea in his burning ship . This form of burial had been that accorded to all Vikings for centuries past . After straining her eyes for a final look at the departing ship , Thelma retraces her steps to her mother 's grave , and there , feeling that she is absolutely alone , prays for the strength to live . Here in a rocky dell before the tomb of her mother , where first she met the man who won her heart , Sir Philip again finds Thelma . A few words suffice to show her how she has been tricked , and a fervent protestation of his love convinces her that she still has a place in his heart . In Sir Philip 's arms she finds comfort for the loss of her father ; she starts out bravely to again face the world , now sure of his unending love . \""

Goring had been ordered by the King to abandon his siege and join the Royalist forces at Naseby , and it has been suggested by modern historians that with his forces , and his leadership , the Royalists might have won the battle .

Aware of the approaching army , Lord Goring mounted a final assault on the town , hoping to catch Blake unaware by sending his cavalry towards the town on 9 July . The attack was neutralised by a section of Fairfax 's army in Ilminster , and Goring withdrew from Taunton to meet Fairfax at the Battle of Langport , relieving the third and final siege of Taunton during the English Civil War ."

The adjective vilovit means \" having a vila 's properties \" or \" vila @-@ like \" . The name vila denotes Slavic nymphs or fairies , female anthropomorphic spirits of woods , mountains , clouds , and waters , who had magical powers . In the region of Tamnava , north @-@ western Central Serbia , the vilovit men were also called vetrenjaks . An early mention of vetrenjaks is found in a short story by Serbian writer Milovan Glišić , published in 1875 . In the story , men from Krnić and nearby villages talk about a battle their vetrenjaks fought on a hill to repel a hail storm brought by alien vetrenjaks . They uprooted oaks and beat each other with them , their bodies turning black and blue from the blows . The defenders were victorious and moved the storm to a mountain , away from their fields ."

What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God . However , such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour . Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes : \" Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things ; I have already granted , that , from the constitution of their bodies , men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue . I speak collectively of the whole sex ; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature . In fact , how can they , if virtue has only one eternal standard ? I must therefore , if I reason consequently , as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction , as that there is a God . \" Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist , particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her ."

The paraconid , metaconid ( both cusps in the trigonid ) , and entoconid ( a cusp in the talonid ) are lower than in Paratriaenops auritus .

    "text": "Military historians have generally drawn the conclusion that the preliminary aerial and naval bombardment of Juno was not as effective as had been hoped , yet differ in their opinions as to how ineffective . The aerial bombardment of Juno 's defences the night before is considered to have been very ineffective , primarily because of the inclement weather . John Keegan notes that \" the prevailing low , thick cloud frustrated its [ Bomber Command 's ] efforts \" . Colonel Stacey — the official historian of the Canadian Army in the Second World War — considers the effects of the bombing runs to have been \" spotty \" , noting that while several coastal batteries were not hit , those that were ( such as the battery at Houlgate ) were hit accurately . Chester Wilmot offers a different view , suggesting that \" [ the coastal guns ] had been accurately bombed , but had survived because they were heavily protected by the concrete casemates Rommel had insisted upon \" . Historians ' assessment of the naval bombardment is even more mixed ; while they generally agree that it failed to fully neutralize German defences on Juno , they are in disagreement as to why . Stacey suggests that while the \" beach @-@ drenching fire \" was concentrated and substantial , it was both inaccurate and of insufficient firepower to destroy the coastal bunkers . He further suggests that the effect of the drenching fire was moral rather than material , in that it forced defenders to keep below @-@ ground and sapped their morale . Terry Copp echoes this analysis , noting that \" reasonable accuracy could not be obtained from the pitching decks of LCTs [ by mounted artillery on the ships ] \" ; the 13th Field Regiment 's drenching fire fell on average 200 yards ( 180 m ) past their targets . British historian Max Hastings notes that because of the delay in landing times by ten minutes , a substantial gap existed between the cessation of bombardment and the actual landing of the first waves of infantry , meaning that platoons of the 716th had ample time to return to their positions . The bombardment of specific strongpoints in the towns along the coast was inconsistent ; the North Shore Regiment reported that the strongpoint near Saint @-@ Aubin \" appeared not to have been touched \" by bombardment , while the strongpoints facing the Canadian Scottish Regiment had been eliminated by naval bombardment before their landing ."

This was a 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) long stick with a notched end to hold a dart or javelin . The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone . Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior . Commoners used blowguns in war , which also served as their hunting weapon . The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting . Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period , its use as a weapon of war was not favoured ; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic . The Contact period Maya also used two @-@ handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian , similar to the Aztec macuahuitl . Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it ; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region . Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins ."

In a 1962 interview in The New Yorker , he further explained : \" When I wrote the first one in 1953 , I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull , uninteresting man to whom things happened ; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God , [ James Bond ] is the dullest name I ever heard . \""

Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher @-@ order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non @-@ human animals ( see previous paragraph ) . Thus , any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties . Nevertheless , some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that increases fitness . In his article \" Evolution of consciousness \" , John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness ( \" [ a ] psychon ... linked to [ a ] dendron through quantum physics \" ) . Bernard Baars proposed that once in place , this \" recursive \" circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms . Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality . This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them ( e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage ) and behave accordingly , and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends ."

In the United States , very large ranges have been reported in Texas and the Black Hills of the northern Great Plains , in excess of 775 km2 ( 300 sq mi ) .

Ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other . Scrape marks , urine , and feces are used to mark territory and attract mates .

A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in Svoboda titled \" In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington , D.C. \" , asking for support from the Shevchenko Scientific Society and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America ( UCCA ) . Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while Lev Dobriansky , a Ukrainian American economist and anti @-@ communism activist , became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko . The activists eventually gained the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Representative Alvin Morell Bentley of Michigan . Javits said \" Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom ... It is fitting that the statue of such a national hero , who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man , should stand in the capital of the U.S. \" and Bentley stated , \" In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its understanding and appreciation of Taras Shevchenko and all that he means to the brave and noble Ukrainian people . \""

    "text": "The foundations of the Pax Mongolica lie in the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century . In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region , Genghis Khan revolutionized the way Mongolian tribal society was structured . After each new victory , more and more people were incorporated under Genghis Khan 's rule , thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe . In 1203 , Genghis Khan , in an effort to strengthen his army , ordered a reform that reorganized his army 's structure while breaking down the traditional clan- and kindred @-@ based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military . He arranged his army into arbans ( inter @-@ ethnic groups of ten ) , and the members of an arban were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin . Ten arbans made a zuun , or a company ; ten zuuns made a myangan , or a battalion ; and ten myangans formed a tumen , or an army of 10 @,@ 000 . This decimal system organization of Genghis Khan 's strong military would prove very effective in conquering , by persuasion or force , the many tribes of the central Asian steppe , but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole . By 1206 Genghis Khan 's military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia , and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of Mongolia ."

These courts were more attractive to the common lawyers because of their informality and the simple method used to arrest defendants . The bills of complaint and subpoena used by the Chancery made court procedure far faster , and from 1460 to 1540 there was a steep decline in the number of cases in the common law courts , coinciding with a sharp increase in cases in the newer courts . This loss of business was quickly recognised by the King 's Bench , which was urged by Fairfax J in 1501 to develop new remedies so that \" subpoenas would not be used as often as they are at present \" .

Historians agree , since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods . Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities , honing skills he would use later in life . El Scipión employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate , such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard ( as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter ) . The capture of the Otter led to a court order requiring restitution , affecting the crew . At this time , Cofresí turned to piracy . Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear , several theories have been proposed by researchers . In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí 's time aboard El Scipión , or seeing a family member become a privateer , may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew 's pay was threatened by the lawsuit .

Once the landing gear was raised , the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position , since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised . The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine , thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank .

The 2 January ceasefire allowed the JNA to retain its positions in East and West Slavonia , which were on the brink of military collapse . As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the previous ceasefire agreement , the UNPROFOR did not start to arrive until 8 March and took two months to fully deploy in the UNPAs . Even though UNPROFOR had placed most of the RSK 's heavy weapons in storage areas jointly controlled by the UN and the RSK by January 1993 , the peacekeeping troops were unable to fulfil the provisions of the Vance plan , such as the disarmament of the RSK militia , the return of refugees , the restoration of civilian authority and establishment of an ethnically mixed police force . The RSK military was retitled as police while the ethnic cleansing of areas under its control continued unchecked . UNPROFOR was compelled to prevent the return of refugees because of poor security conditions . No attempt was made to establish an ethnically mixed police force . UNPROFOR also failed to remove RSK forces from areas outside designated UNPAs that were under RSK control when the Implementation Agreement ceasefire was signed . Those areas — later better known as the \" pink zones \" — were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset .

The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as the Bible , but they also believed that the Bible , or Scripture , is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God . The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time . Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points , marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation , of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original . This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics . Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity , that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone . English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine . The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible , and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture . While the issue of biblical inerrancy , the belief that there are no errors in the Bible , did not arise until the eighteenth century , the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors . Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration , believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God . On the other hand , they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles . They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration ."

He was the son of Robert de Ufford , who was created Earl of Suffolk by Edward III in 1337 . William had three older brothers who all predeceased him , and in 1369 he succeeded his father . In the 1370s , he participated in several campaigns of the Hundred Years ' War , but this period was not a successful one for England . Suffolk was closely connected to Thomas Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick and John of Gaunt , Duke of Lancaster , and his conciliatory skills were highly valued in national politics . He helped arbitrate in the conflict between Gaunt and the parliamentary Commons during the Good Parliament . In 1381 , Suffolk took part in suppressing the Peasants ' Revolt in East Anglia , after narrowly escaping the rebels himself . He died suddenly in 1382 while attending parliament , and since he had no surviving children , his title became extinct and his property was dispersed ."

The rebate would supplement accrued savings , covering taxes up to the poverty level .

The protagonist in \" Never Marry a Mexican \" is haunted by the myth of la Malinche , who is considered a whore and a traitor , and defies la Malinche 's passive sexuality with her own aggressive one . In \" Woman Hollering Creek \" the protagonist reinvents the la Llorona myth when she decides to take charge of her own future , and that of her children , and discovers that the grito of the myth , which is the Spanish word for the sound made by la Llorona , can be interpreted as a \" joyous holler \" rather than a grieving wail . It is the borderland , that symbolic middle ground between two cultures , which \" offers a space where such a negotiation with fixed gender ideals is at least possible \" ."

The Enbom case involved Fritiof Enbom , a former worker at the Swedish State Railways in Boden , and later the local editor for the communist newspaper Norrskensflamman . He was exposed by his own careless talk — often under the influence of alcohol — to the owners of the house in Stockholm where he had lodged since he moved there from Boden . The family told the Swedish Security Service after the Christmas holidays of 1951 , and Enbom was arrested on 16 February 1952 . During interrogation , he confessed that he — from February 1943 to April 1951 — had met with Soviet employers around 25 times . Enbom had provided a large variety of intelligence , most of it from public sources , but also secrets , of which the armament of one of the forts in the fortress was one of the pieces of information that concerned Boden Fortress and nearby fortifications . He was sentenced to lifetime hard labour , but was released after ten years . The other case involved Ernst Hilding Andersson , who was arrested on 21 September 1951 .

    "text": "Initially , by analogy with the neutron magic number 126 , the next proton shell was also expected to occur at element 126 , too far away from the synthesis capabilities of the mid @-@ 20th century to achieve much theoretical attention . In 1966 , new values for the potential and spin @-@ orbit interaction in this region of the periodic table contradicted this and predicted that the next proton shell would occur instead at element 114 , and that nuclides in this region would be as stable against spontaneous fission as many heavy nuclei such as lead @-@ 208 . The expected closed neutron shells in this region were at neutron number 184 or 196 , thus making 298Fl and 310Fl candidates for being doubly magic . 1972 estimates predicted a half @-@ life of about a year for 298Fl , which was expected to be near a large island of stability with the longest half @-@ life at darmstadtium @-@ 294 ( 1010 years , comparable to that of 232Th ) . After the synthesis of the first isotopes of elements 112 through 118 at the turn of the 21st century , it was found that the synthesized neutron @-@ deficient isotopes were stabilized against fission . In 2008 it was thus hypothesized that the stabilization against fission of these nuclides was due to their being oblate nuclei , and that a region of oblate nuclei was centred on 288Fl . Additionally , new theoretical models showed that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f7 / 2 ( filled at element 114 ) and 2f5 / 2 ( filled at element 120 ) was smaller than expected , so that element 114 no longer appeared to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell . The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around 306Ubb , but the expected low half @-@ life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging . Nevertheless , the island of stability is still expected to exist in this region of the periodic table , and nearer its centre ( which has not been approached closely enough yet ) some nuclides , such as 291Uup and its alpha- and beta @-@ decay daughters , may be found to decay by positron emission or electron capture and thus move into the centre of the island . Due to the expected high fission barriers , any nucleus within this island of stability decays exclusively by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay , both of which would bring the nuclei closer to the beta stability line where the island is expected to be . Electron capture is needed to reach the island , which is problematic because it is not certain that electron capture becomes a major decay mode in this region of the chart of nuclides ."

These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals : for example , potassium has nine different known phosphides , with formulae K3P , K4P3 , K5P4 , KP , K4P6 , K3P7 , K3P11 , KP10.3 , and KP15 .

A monument honoring Schybi and Emmenegger was unveiled at Escholzmatt on July 26 , 1903 , at Rüderswil , a statue in honor of Leuenberger was erected the same year , and at Liestal an obelisk honoring the peasant victims of the war was inaugurated on September 25 , 1904 . More statues and plaques were installed in various other places at the tricentennial of the war in 1953 , for instance a relief showing Schybi in a chapel at Sursee , where the peasant leader had been incarcerated ."

First , interests must be \" sufficient to give grounds for holding another to be under a duty \" . Judging this entails considering the strength of an interest as well as \" all other considerations \" ; so , for example , individuals may have a very strong interest in free expression , but , \" all things considered \" , this fact does not necessitate the protection of slander . The greater interest of the victim of slander can outweigh the interest in free expression , and so context is important . This is the difference between prima facie rights and concrete rights . The former exist on an abstract level outside of particular circumstances . Prima facie rights can translate into concrete rights when considered in particular situations , but they do not always , as the free expression example illustrates . The account is for moral rights , and Cochrane 's normative claims are intended to form part of a \" democratic underlaboring \" , informing and persuading political communities ."

However , players can only proceed to other regions of the Sirius sector , where more advanced ships , weaponry , and equipment are obtained , after completing missions that advance the story . Some stages are not introduced until the character has achieved a certain level ( based on total worth accumulated ) , and it is not possible to gain sufficient levels just through the story itself , so players must spend at least some time on side missions to gain money to advance to the level required for the next stage of the story . This is also necessary as some stages would be too tough with only the money and items collected in the story ."

It then moved south and joined XVII Corps of the Third Army to train for the Battle of the Somme . New trenches were dug and the division made practice attacks on them using novel tactics : attacking in waves in conjunction with artillery and machine gun fire . Towards the end of the month , the division moved further south to the Somme valley . They then joined II Corps and were placed in reserve . The role of the division was as a second wave to exploit the expected success . Following the breach of the German lines , the Reserve Army cavalry divisions would capture Bapaume . The 38th ( Welsh ) Division would then move forward to relieve the cavalry and secure the town , to allow the cavalry to advance north towards Arras ."

Vogels was contacted by Brandon Maxwell Studios from New York — Gaga 's stylist — for designer pieces available for the concert . According to the milliner the crown almost never reached Gaga since the entire shipment was seized in Anchorage , Alaska due to the feathers on the piece being subjected to wildlife import issues with US customs officials . After much paperwork for five days the millinery designs were finally released and arrived just in time for the Cheek to Cheek promotional photo shoot . Vogels recalled , \" It was nerve racking and exciting at the same time and a relief when the shipment was finally released from customs . \" Maxwell said that he and his team did the wardrobe for the dancers and Gaga , and first took references from Wilson regarding the set and lighting designs . The team then started with eight full racks of clothing , between 200 and 300 dresses , and afterwards zeroed in on eight costumes for the show , along with its accessories . Regarding the absence of jewellery , Maxwell explained that most of the outfits \" were more about the silhouette and structure of gowns \" and too much of accessories would have been a distraction . He wanted the emphasis on Gaga 's vocals , hence the jewellery usage was reduced . Designers used for the costumes include Roberto Cavalli , Michael Costello , Mathieu Mirano , Valentino as well as David Samuel Menkes , who created the leather jumpsuit . Gaga had wanted costumes with teal or turquoise colours and flowing gowns , belted in the middle . Maxwell took care to ensure that the dresses were not too tight in Gaga 's abdomen area , since it would have been difficult for her to sing . Sandals were provided by Brian Atwood , Stuart Weitzman and Sophia Webster , while a pair of boots were designed by Giuseppe Zanotti . They created custom made shoes which made Gaga appear tall and move freely in the long gowns ."

    "text": "A hypothesis of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers , but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction . After just two years , juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus , and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals . This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains . Mortality rates doubled at age twelve , perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase , and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen . This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood , perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation , including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources , and eventually , the ever @-@ increasing effects of senescence . The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation . Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes . High infant mortality rates , followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity , with very few animals reaching maximum size , is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals , including elephants , African buffalo , and rhinoceros . The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids . The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis , but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role , especially since more than two @-@ thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality ."

    "text": "In recent years , historians such as Harry Jaffa , Herman Belz , John Diggins , Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln 's redefinition of republican values . As early as the 1850s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution , Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values — what he called the \" sheet anchor \" of republicanism . The Declaration 's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the Constitution 's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate . As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 , \" Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself . \" His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms . Nevertheless , in 1861 , Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms ( the Constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree ) , and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state . Burton ( 2008 ) argues that Lincoln 's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated ."

His lack of contribution was highlighted against the backdrop of his team 's crushing innings victory : O 'Neill failed to score a run or take a wicket . New South Wales bowled first and had South Australia at 6 / 49 when Miller introduced O 'Neill 's occasional leg spin , presumably to ease the debutant 's nerves by bringing him into the game . The home team struck 18 from three overs . O 'Neill was listed to bat in the lower middle order but after the top order had made a big start , Miller brought O 'Neill up . He came in against the second new ball and was clean bowled . O 'Neill was dropped and did not play another match for the season , but had gained invaluable experience ."

The concurrent PA 43 designation was also removed from US 309 . In 1941 , PA 145 was realigned to follow Seventh Street Pike south from Eagle Point to Allentown and 7th Street in Allentown to US 22 / US 309 / PA 29 at 7th and Tilghman streets in Allentown , with PA 329 realigned to follow the former alignment of PA 145 between Cementon and Bath . The section of Seventh Street Pike between Center Street and Eagle Point was constructed as a concrete road in 1941 . The portion of PA 145 along Seventh Street Pike was widened to four lanes between Allentown and west of Coplay by 1947 .

The Moving Picture World announced that the film would feature Heming and Crane , but Bowers also credits the \" Thanhouser Kid \" Marie Eline in an unknown role . It is unknown , but possible , that Eline may have played the role of the young boy usher .

Eline would also star as Hans in The Little Hero of Holland . It is unknown if Anna Rosemond , the other leading lady of Thanhouser , had a role in this film ."

The Royalists seeing an opportunity to engage the divided force turned around to engage but Lilburne decided to hold his ground deploying cavalry on Wigan Lane and infantry in the hedgerows to the sides , The Royalists made several charges but after two hours were unable to break the Parliamentarian line and were forced to flee after being overwhelmed by superior numbers . Although Stanley was injured he managed to find refuge in the town . David Craine states , \" those who did not fall in the fighting [ were ] hunted to their death through the countryside \" .

A volcanic pipe containing diamonds is known as a primary source of diamonds . Secondary sources of diamonds include all areas where a significant number of diamonds have been eroded out of their kimberlite or lamproite matrix , and accumulated because of water or wind action . These include alluvial deposits and deposits along existing and ancient shorelines , where loose diamonds tend to accumulate because of their size and density . Diamonds have also rarely been found in deposits left behind by glaciers ( notably in Wisconsin and Indiana ) ; in contrast to alluvial deposits , glacial deposits are minor and are therefore not viable commercial sources of diamond ."

One of these was originally found by Humphrey Wyems , a London lawyer , who may have discovered it in a tailor 's shop . The other was found in Dover Castle in 1630 by Sir Edward Dering . The Dering charter is usually identified as the copy originally sent to the Cinque Ports in 1215 . ( In 2015 it was announced that David Carpenter had found Dering 's copy to be identical to a 1290s transcription made from Canterbury Cathedral 's 1215 copy and so he suggests that the Dering copy 's destination was the Cathedral rather than the Cinque Ports . ) This copy was damaged in the Cotton library fire of 1731 , when its seal was badly melted .

Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare , one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb : dropped from an aircraft , it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over the surface of the water which it then ignited . Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread . American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin ; though it is not clear what he personally saw , it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours . The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge , and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived .

He reportedly succeeded with minimal bloodshed . According to oral history , the mere encampment of his army at the foot of Analamanga was sufficient to secure the submission of the Vazimba . Andrianjaka 's army then cleared the forest covering the hill 's summit and built a traditional rova to serve as an initial garrison , including an unnamed simple wooden house within it as a palace for the king . Soon afterward Andrianjaka built two more houses , reportedly named Masoandrotsiroa ( \" There Are Not Two Suns \" , also called Masoandro ) and Besakana ( \" Great Breadth \" ) . According to another account , Besakana may have been the name of the very first of the three houses Andrianjaka built within the Rova . The king also designated the construction site and design for the royal tombs he named Trano Masina Fitomiandalana ( \" Seven Sacred Houses Arranged in Order \" , also called Fitomiandalana ) , which were to be laid out in a line . Andrianjaka 's own tomb was the first of these to be built ."

The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1877 continued a process of change imposed by Parliament that had begun in the middle of the 19th century , and empowered a group of commissioners to lay down new statutes for the university and its colleges . The commissioners ' powers included the ability to rewrite trusts and directions attached to gifts that were 50 years old or more .

With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved , the Battle of the Bulge was the largest single battle on the Western Front during the war . On Christmas Day the division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance ; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur . The 3rd Parachute Brigade were on the left , 5th Parachute Brigade on the right , and the airlanding brigade in reserve . Over the next days the German advance was halted and forced back , until at the end of January 1945 , the brigade crossed into the Netherlands . Here the division was made responsible for the area along the River Maas , between Venlo and Roermond . The brigade carried out patrols , on both sides of the river , against their opponents from the German 7th Parachute Division . Near the end of February the division returned to England to prepare for another airborne mission , to cross the River Rhine into Germany ."

    "text": "This scene is remarkable not only for its vividness but as one of the few parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content . The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society . For every \" I have not ... \" in the Negative Confession , it is possible to read an unexpressed \" Thou shalt not \" . While the Ten Commandments of Judeo @-@ Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation , the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality . Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute , with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife . John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality ; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths , it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure . Ogden Goelet says \" without an exemplary and moral existence , there was no hope for a successful afterlife \" , while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons , and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased 's moral behaviour ."

    "text": "Most of the fifth chapter of the Bala Kanda Book of the Adhyatma Ramayana ( embedded in the Brahmanda Purana , c . 14th century ) is dedicated to the Ahalya episode . Like most other versions of the story , Ahalya is turned into stone and advised to engross herself in meditation of Rama , \" the Supreme Lord \" . When Rama touches the stone with his foot on Vishvamitra 's advice , Ahalya rises as a beautiful maiden and sings a long panegyric dedicated to Rama . She describes his iconographic form and exalts him as an avatar of Vishnu and source of the universe to whom many divinities pay their respects . After worshipping him , she returns to Gautama . At the end of the narrative , Ahalya 's hymn is prescribed as an ideal benediction for a devotee to gain Rama 's favour . The Awadhi Ramacharitamanasa ( 16th century ) drops the narrative of Indra 's visit to Ahalya . In this epic , Vishvamitra tells Rama that the cursed Ahalya has assumed the form of a rock and is patiently awaiting the dust from Rama 's feet . Ahalya tells Rama that Gautama was right to pronounce the curse , and she deems it as the greatest favour , for as a result , she feasted her eyes on Rama , who liberated her from her worldly existence . As in the Adhyatma Ramayana , Ahalya lauds Rama as the great Lord served by other divinities , asks for the boon of eternal engrossment in his devotion and afterwards leaves for her husband 's abode . The narrative ends with praise for Rama 's compassion . Tulsidas alludes to this episode numerous times in the Ramacharitamanasa while highlighting the significance of Rama 's benevolence . Commenting on this narrative in the Ramacharitamanasa , Rambhadracharya says that Rama destroyed three things : the sin of Ahalya by his sight , the curse by the dust of his feet and the affliction by the touch of his feet , evidenced by the use of the Tribhangi ( meaning \" destroyer of the three \" ) metre in the verses which form Ahalya 's panegyric ."

Compounding this error , the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard ( seaward ) sides , from which they expected the attack would have to come ; their landward port sides were unprepared . The port side gun ports were closed , and the decks on that side were uncleared , with various stored items blocking access to the guns .

During spawning , the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel , and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest , covering the eggs with the displaced gravel .

The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat . Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or alevin . In approximately two weeks , the yolk sac is completely consumed and fry commence feeding mainly on zooplankton . The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area , habitat , life history and quality and quantity of food . As fry grow , they begin to develop \" parr \" marks or dark vertical bars on their sides . In this juvenile stage , immature trout are often called \" parr \" because of the marks . These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger . In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs , some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or \" carryover \" for several seasons before they are caught or perish ."

Around 1881 , he recorded on paper his short pizzicato piece Vattendroppar ( Water Drops ) for violin and cello although it might just have been a musical exercise .

On May 13 , 1913 , the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act was passed , creating the State Trunkline Highway System . The MSHD assigned internal highway numbers to roads in the system , and in 1919 , the numbers were signposted along the roads and marked on maps . The US Highway System was created in 1926 , and highways in Michigan were renumbered to account for the new designations . Legislation in the 1930s consolidated control of the state trunklines in the state highway department . During the 1940s , the first freeways were built in Michigan . With the introduction of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s , the state aborted an effort to build the Michigan Turnpike , a tolled freeway in the southeast corner of the LP .

Earthquake swarm data have been used to analyze how well Lōʻihi 's rocks propagate seismic waves and to investigate the relationship between earthquakes and eruptions . This low level activity is periodically punctuated by large swarms of earthquakes , each swarm comprising up to hundreds of earthquakes . The majority of the earthquakes are not distributed close to the summit , though they follow a north – south trend . Rather , most of the earthquakes occur in the southwest portion of Lōʻihi . The largest recorded swarms took place on Lōʻihi in 1971 , 1972 , 1975 , 1991 – 92 and 1996 . The nearest seismic station is around 30 km ( 20 mi ) from Lōʻihi , on the south coast of Hawaiʻi .

The primary purpose of the division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process . Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake , the second largest CVP water @-@ storage reservoir , with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW . Lewiston Dam , downstream of Trinity Dam , diverts water into the Clear Creek Tunnel , which travels to empty into a third reservoir , Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek , a tributary of the Sacramento River , generating 154 MW of power in the process . Whiskeytown Lake ( formed by Clair . A Hill Whiskeytown Dam ) in turn provides water to the Spring Creek Tunnel , which travels into the lowermost extreme of Spring Creek , a stream that flows into Keswick Reservoir , generating another 180 MW of electricity . From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River . In 1963 , the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel , to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river ."

He further stated that he lied about his name so that he could help solve the case . At the end , he still pushes that Regali is the real murderer of Doggett 's son , and not him . Later on , Doggett approaches Regali . Regali tells him a \" hypothetical \" story about how a pedophile took a young boy to his home . A \" businessman \" then walked in on the incident , realized that the boy has seen his face , and feared that the boy might associate him with the crime . The businessman then found a solution to the boy seeing his face : he murdered him . Regali then walks away and Doggett , filled with rage , unholsters his gun and follows . But a gunshot rings out and when Doggett gets outside , he sees Regali has been killed by Follmer . Later , Doggett and Barbara scatter Luke 's ashes into the ocean , finally achieving the release he has sought ."

For the first time since 1977 's Animals , designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover . His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach , inspired by a phrase from \" Yet Another Movie \" and Gilmour 's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house , as well as \" vestiges of relationships that have evaporated , leaving only echoes \" . The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds , placed on Saunton Sands in Devon ( where some of the scenes for Pink Floyd – The Wall were filmed ) . The beds were arranged by Thorgerson 's colleague Colin Elgie . A hang glider can be seen in the sky , a clear reference to \" Learning to Fly \" . The photographer , Robert Dowling , won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image , which took about two weeks to create .

Immanuel Kant asserted that the world as we perceive it is organized according to a set of fundamental \" intuitions \" , which include object ( we perceive the world as a set of distinct things ) ; shape ; quality ( color , warmth , etc . ) ; space ( distance , direction , and location ) ; and time . Some of these constructs , such as space and time , correspond to the way the world is structured by the laws of physics ; for others the correspondence is not as clear . Understanding the physical basis of qualities , such as redness or pain , has been particularly challenging . David Chalmers has called this the hard problem of consciousness . Some philosophers have argued that it is intrinsically unsolvable , because qualities ( \" qualia \" ) are ineffable ; that is , they are \" raw feels \" , incapable of being analyzed into component processes . Most psychologists and neuroscientists reject these arguments . For example , research on ideasthesia shows that qualia are organised into a semantic @-@ like network . Nevertheless , it is clear that the relationship between a physical entity such as light and a perceptual quality such as color is extraordinarily complex and indirect , as demonstrated by a variety of optical illusions such as neon color spreading ."

As a proof of the concept , he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem . Building the design , the first known functional reflecting telescope , today known as a Newtonian telescope , involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique . Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal , using Newton 's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes . In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope . It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image . In 1671 , the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope . Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes , Of Colours , which he later expanded into the work Opticks . When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton 's ideas , Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate . Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679 – 80 , when Hooke , appointed to manage the Royal Society 's correspondence , opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions , which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector ( see Newton 's law of universal gravitation – History and De motu corporum in gyrum ) .

' s \" cheesy pop side \" , and is based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol . \" Teqkilla \" is the only track to address her relationship with Bronfman , through a reference to Seagram , the company owned by his family . \" It Takes a Muscle \" is a cover version of a track originally recorded in 1982 by Dutch group Spectral Display , and is performed in a reggae style . The opening track \" The Message \" , featuring a male lead vocalist , parodies the words of the traditional song \" Dem Bones \" to link Google to \" the government \" . Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova , the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow 's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband , were inner @-@ world issues pondered in \" Lovalot \" with \" a mixture of nonsense rhyme , militant posturing and pop @-@ cultural free @-@ flow ; her London glottal stop mischievously turns ' I love a lot ' into ' I love Allah ' \" .

The song doesn 't justify anything , but it reminds us that there is a person behind every lit fuse \" . Powers also commented on how \" Born Free \" mixed the boasting style often found in hip hop music with lines depicting the lives of those enduring poverty and persecution . \" Illygirl \" , a track found only on the deluxe edition of the album , is written from the point of view of an abused but tough teenager , whom critic Robert Christgau said could be the \" kid @-@ sister @-@ in @-@ metaphor \" of the swaggering persona adopted by M.I.A. on the track \" Steppin Up \" ."

As far as sounds go , it 's basically drums , bass , some heavy guitars and Shirley singing . \" Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album . \" A lot of songs took shape in just a few hours as opposed to a few months with the last record . [ ... ] Some of the songs obviously took a long time , or we wouldn 't have been in the studio for a full year . But a lot of them happened very quickly . ' Silence Is Golden ' we recorded basically in three days and it was done . ' So Like a Rose , ' for the most part , was recorded in three hours .

Berkeley felt it was related to Agaricus ostreatus ( now Pleurotus ostreatus ) but remarked it was a \" far more magnificent species \" . Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist James Drummond in 1841 on Banksia wood along the Swan River . He wrote \" when this fungus was laid on a newspaper , it emitted by night a phosphorescent light , enabling us to read the words around it ; and it continued to do so for several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up . \" More material collected from near the base of a \" sickly but living \" shrub ( Grevillea drummondii ) was named as Agaricus lampas by Berkeley . He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species . Tasmanian botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn collected material in October 1845 from that state , which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less decurrent gills and a shorter stipe , and named it Agaricus phosphorus in 1848 . Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo placed all three named taxa in the genus Pleurotus in 1887 . These names have been synonymised with O. nidiformis , although the name Pleurotus lampas persisted in some texts , including the 1934 – 35 monograph of Australian fungi by John Burton Cleland . In reviewing the published literature , Victorian botanical liaison officer Jim Willis was aware of Rolf Singer 's placing of Pleurotus olearius into the genus Omphalotus , but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across , even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in Pleurotus . Investigating the species in 1994 , Orson K. Miller , Jr. gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus Omphalotus with other bioluminescent mushrooms ."

During the breeding season it is solitary but at other times of year it is gregarious . Flocks move in to a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth .

These are abundant on the desert floor , remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs . The birds are very wary and easily frightened . Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird . The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead . When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze . So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on . Sandgrouse need to make a daily journey to a drinking hole , which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground . They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as , beside the falcons , mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds . When all is safe , another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds ."

Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai . The British ignored his overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras ( modern Chennai ) and was able to successfully sue for peace . In 1770 , when the Maratha armies of Madhavrao Peshwa invaded Mysore ( three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider , in which Haider lost ) , Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him by staying out of the conflict . The British betrayal and Haider 's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider 's deep distrust of the British — a sentiment that would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo @-@ Mysore rivalries of the next three decades . In 1777 , Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas .

In practice , favorable conditions are identified by screening ; a very large batch of the molecules is prepared , and a wide variety of crystallization solutions are tested . Hundreds , even thousands , of solution conditions are generally tried before finding the successful one .

It is also common to try several temperatures for encouraging crystallization , or to gradually lower the temperature so that the solution becomes supersaturated .

Weesner indicated that the Mastotermitidae termites may go back to the Late Permian , 251 million years ago , and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of Mastotermes of the Mastotermitidae , the most primitive living termite , have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas . It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous . Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus Cryptocercus . The folded wings of the fossil wood roach Pycnoblattina , arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1a and 2a , resemble those seen in Mastotermes , the only living insect with the same pattern . Krishna et al . , though , consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera . Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system , evolving more than 100 million years ago ."

Defeating Cold Man unlocks Burner Man and Pirate Man ; defeating Astro Man unlocks Dynamo Man , Tengu Man , and Pirate Man ; and defeating Ground Man unlocks Magic Man and Tengu Man . Clearing one of these unlocked stages opens the way to a security room where the player must destroy a series of crystals with obtained Robot Master weapons . Bypassing all eight crystals opens the way to the fortress stages . In a similar fashion to previous installments in the series , enemies often drop bolts after they are destroyed , and these can be exchanged for various restorative items and upgrades . However , unlike in Mega Man 7 the security cavern offers a way to obtain large amounts of bolts without having to repeatedly visit stages . Some upgrades are unique to either character , such as Mega Man 's ability to call on his dog Rush to search for items , or an adaptor for Bass to combine with his wolf Treble to temporarily fly . Also distributed throughout the introduction and Robot Master levels are a collection of 100 data CDs that contain information on many prominent characters in the series . Most of the CDs are hidden either behind obstacles that need to be destroyed with a special weapon or accessed with a character @-@ specific ability , making it impossible to collect them all on a single playthrough . CDs collected in each playthrough are permanently placed in a database and remain unlocked after beating the game . Saved games are used in place of the series ' traditional password system ."

The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until the turn of the 18th century . Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers ' Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Blandford Forum , and St George 's Church on the Isle of Portland , which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren . From the late 18th century onwards , churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style . A notable exception to this trend , however , is the Church of St Mary in East Lulworth — the first freestanding Roman Catholic church built in England after the Reformation . George III gave permission to erect the building on the condition that it resembled a garden mausoleum rather than a church . It was completed in 1789 . Bournemouth , founded in 1810 , has a wealth of 19th @-@ century churches including St Peter 's and St Stephen 's .

PSR B1937 + 21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse . Until 1995 , the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar , and by 2006 , there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses out of more than 1500 known pulsars . The giant pulses of PSR B1937 + 21 were first observed in 1984 , shortly after its discovery , but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937 + 21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed . In more recent follow up observations , more giant pulses have been found . These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse . The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar , lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds . The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable , but has been observed to be as high as 6 @.@ 5 × 10 − 22 Wm − 2Hz − 1 ( 6 @.@ 5 × 104 janskys ) .

The contemporary Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle recorded how \" there was nothing but disturbance and wickedness and robbery \" . Certainly in many parts of the country , such as Wiltshire , Berkshire , the Thames Valley and East Anglia , the fighting and raiding had caused serious devastation .

    "text": "Horses were likely confined primarily to the Sydney region until the early 19th century , when settlers first crossed the Blue Mountains and opened expansion inland . Horses were required for travel , and for cattle and sheep droving as the pastoral industry grew . The first report of an escaped horse is in 1804 , and by the 1840s some horses had escaped from settled regions of Australia . It is likely that some escaped because fences were not properly installed , when fences existed at all , but it is believed that most Australian horses became feral because they were released into the wild and left to fend for themselves . This may have been the result of pastoralists abandoning their settlements , and thus their horses , due to the arid conditions and unfamiliar land that combined to make farming in Australia especially difficult . After World War I , the demand for horses by defence forces declined with the growth in mechanization , which led to a growth in the number of unwanted animals that were often set free . Throughout the 20th century , the replacement of horses with machines in farming led to further falls in demand , and therefore may have also contributed to increases in feral populations ."

Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc . Over time , the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces . This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine , causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae . As a result , there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass . When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease , the makeup of a disc changes : blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and / or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root . Any of these changes may result in back pain ."

These updates were designed to bring the MP4 @-@ 30 in line with the designs developed by other teams .

With Alonso out of the points , Button was promoted to sixth . The race also saw what would be the car 's best qualifying performance as Alonso started eleventh , while the six points Button scored saw the team close to within ten points of Sauber in the World Constructors ' Championship . However , the result also meant that McLaren had endured its longest winless streak of fifty @-@ three races , previously set between the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix and the 1981 British Grand Prix .

Realising that France was too powerful to be forced to make peace by a single victory , however , Eugene , Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves . For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France . This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine , and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself . Trier was taken on 26 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene ; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December , the campaign season for 1704 came to an end ."

    "text": "Poena cullei ( from Latin ' punishment of the sack ' ) under Roman law was a type of death penalty imposed on a subject who had been found guilty of parricide . The punishment consisted of being sewn up in a leather sack , sometimes with an assortment of live animals , and then being thrown into water . The punishment may have varied widely in its frequency and precise form during the Roman period . For example , the earliest fully documented case is from ca . 100BCE , although scholars think the punishment may have developed about a century earlier ( earlier than that , murderers , including parricides , would be handed over to the aggrieved family for punishment , rather than punishment being enacted by Roman state officials ) . Inclusion of live animals in the sack is only documented from Early Imperial times , and at the beginning , only snakes are mentioned . At the time of Emperor Hadrian ( 2nd century CE ) , the most well known form of the punishment was documented , where a cock , a dog , a monkey and a viper were inserted in the sack . However , at the time of Hadrian poena cullei was made into an optional form of punishment for parricides ( the alternate being thrown to the beasts in the arena ) . During the 3rd century CE up to the accession of Emperor Constantine , poena cullei fell out of use ; Constantine revived it , now with only serpents to be added in the sack . Well over 200 years later , Emperor Justinian reinstituted the punishment with the four animals , and poena cullei remained the statutory penalty for parricides within Byzantine law for the next 400 years , when it was replaced with the punishment for parricides to be burnt alive instead ."

    "text": "The second common parasitoid , Elasmus polistis , also has disastrous effects on the P. exclamans nest . Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell . The males emerge first , and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge . Once the female moths emerge , the males will mate and reproduce , quickly destroying the P. exclamans population . In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P. exclamans cannot find them . This is important to the survival of P. exclamans . The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests . This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective , as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts . In one experiment conducted , it was found that over 60 % of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981 . It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized . This is due to the fact that the large nests are typically older . This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens ’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens ’ nests ."

As many of the Mill Creek valley 's settlers were of German descent , the Old Pine Church structure may also have been built as a meeting place for Brethren adherents , known as \" Dunkers \" or \" Dunkards \" .

The Brethren was a Christian denomination of Anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by triune immersion and exercised nonresistance . Triune immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times , once for each of the entities of the Holy Trinity . Brethren adherents believed only in the New Testament , and professed no other creeds . The interior of Old Pine Church , which consists of a single common space for all worshippers , also illustrates the building 's connection with the Brethren and the denomination 's beliefs regarding slavery .

Fleming owned a cottage in St Margaret 's at Cliffe , near Dover , and he went to great lengths to get the details of the area right , including lending his car to his stepson to time the journey from London to Deal for the car chase passage . Fleming used his experiences of London clubs for the background of the Blades scenes .

The population explosion and the building of homes , railroads , and mines in northern Idaho and southern British Columbia fueled the industry . Although overshadowed in importance by the vast timbered areas on the coastal regions west of the Cascades , and burdened with monopolistic rail freight rates and stiff competition , Spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors , window sashes , blinds , and other planing mill products . Rail freight rates were much higher in Spokane than the rates in coastal seaport cities such as Seattle and Portland , so much so that Minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to Seattle and then back to Spokane for less than shipping directly to Spokane , even though the rail line ran through Spokane on the way to the coast .

The 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals , which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population . Growth in the 1920s and 1930s remained slow but less drastically so , forcing city boosters to market the city as a quiet , comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity . The Inland Empire was heavily dependent on natural resources and extractive goods produced from mines , forests , and farms , which experienced a fall in demand .

They instead rampaged through the communities on both sides of the Mohawk , destroying 63 homes , a similar number of barns , three grist mills , and one saw mill . They drove off a large number of horses , cattle , and sheep , killing those they could not take with them . The only buildings left standing were the forts , a barn , the church , and the homes of the minister and a few Loyalists . More than 700 people were made homeless by their destruction . Because of Helmer 's warning only three Americans were killed . Captain Caldwell wrote that his men \" would have in all probability killed most of the inhabitants of German Flatts had they not been apprised of our coming by one of the scouts getting in and warning of our approach , and perhaps got to their forts \" ."

Many of these studies were conducted on Barro Colorado Island in Panama or at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica . Of particular interest is how it competes with other species and with individuals of the same species at different stages in its life cycle . The seedlings are normally limited by the amount of light and nutrients found where they are growing and the saplings are considered relatively light demanding compared to other species . Young individuals are more likely to survive when they grow further away from their parents and when there are few other individuals growing near to them , which may be due to them being able to escape diseases . Plant physiologists have investigated how the leaves of the tree differ depending on their location in the forest canopy finding they are thicker in the canopy and thinner in the understory . They have also measured how the water potential of their leaves changes and when their stomata open and close during the day ; the findings suggest that rather than closing their stomata to control water loss , it is controlled by the leaf area instead . Population geneticists have examined the way in which its genes vary , at both the local scale and across its range using microsatellites .

Cisneros allowed free trade as well , as instructed by the Junta of Seville , which benefited British merchants ; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War . The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy , moral values , social usages , religious practices , and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy . As a result , Cisneros closed trade again , restoring the Spanish monopsony . A group of hacendados ( owners of haciendas ) , who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo , asked Moreno to defend them . Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners , a report that represented the export interest of the landowners , encouraged free trade , and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony . It is considered the most comprehensive economic report from the time of the viceroyalty . It represented the new European economic ideas , and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled . Several authors have questioned Moreno 's authorship of the paper , considering it instead an update of another , previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano , Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires , written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers . This report , as well as Moreno 's prestige in the colonial society , helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros . Yet secretly , Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy ."

Their daily movement is influenced by the tides ; one tracking study showed that they are more active during high tides . Uniquely among rays they dig with their snouts in the sand , surrounding themselves in a cloud of sand that spews from their gills . They also exhibit two motions in which the abdomen and the pectoral fins are moved rapidly up and down : the pelvic thrust and the extreme pelvic thrust . The pelvic thrust is usually performed by a solitary ray , and repeated four to five times rapidly . The extreme pelvic thrust is most commonly observed when the ray is swimming in a group , from which it will separate itself before vigorously thrusting with its pectoral fins . The rays also performs dips and jumps ; in a dip the ray will dive and then come back up rapidly , perhaps as many as five times consecutively . There are two main types of jump : in one , the ray propels itself vertically out of the water , to which it returns along the same line ; the other is when the ray leaps at a 45 degree angle , often repeated multiple times at high speeds . When in shallow waters or outside their normal swimming areas the rays are most commonly seen alone , but they do also congregate in schools . One form of traveling is called loose aggregation , which is when three to sixteen rays are swimming in a loose group , with occasional interactions between them . A school commonly consists of six or more rays swimming in the same direction at exactly the same speed ."

On November 15 , the defense rested its case without calling Guandique to the stand . Other prison witnesses called by the defense refuted Morales ' testimony . Jose Manuel Alaniz said that Guandique made no mention of rape or murder while sharing a cell with both Alaniz and Morales at the penitentiary in Kentucky . Alaniz admitted under cross @-@ examination that he \" didn 't want to be too nosy \" and was often asleep at the prison while recovering from a gunshot wound . The prosecution dropped two more charges because the statute of limitations had passed : kidnapping and attempted robbery . During closing arguments for the remaining charges of first @-@ degree murder committed during a kidnapping and during a robbery , prosecutor Amanda Haines contended that Guandique bound and gagged Levy after attacking her , leaving her to die of dehydration or exposure in the park . Defense attorney Santha Sonenberg countered with the lack of any DNA evidence connecting Guandique to the crime scene . Calling the prosecution 's case \" fiction \" , Sonenberg suggested that Levy had been murdered elsewhere , with her dead body being dumped in the park ."

It took some time for the HBC to acquire the necessary ships , skilled seamen , trade goods , and intelligence about the coast trade . Simpson decided that the \" London ships \" , which brought goods to Fort Vancouver and returned to England with furs , should arrive early enough to make a coasting voyage before departing . The first London ship to do this was the schooner Cadboro , in 1827 . However , its voyage did not get beyond the Strait of Georgia and only 2 sea otter and 28 land otter and beaver skins were acquired . In 1828 the HBC decided to deploy three ships for the coast trade , but setbacks caused delays . The William and Ann was lost in 1829 , and the Isabella in 1830 , both at the Columbia Bar . The HBC 's shipping was inadequate for the coast trade until the middle 1830s . In 1835 two ships were added to the HBC 's coast fleet .

    "text": "However , the above @-@ mentioned historic process of determining the age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought , since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color @-@ magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters , many of which are still being actively researched . Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters ( e.g. , blue hook stars ) , or feature multiple populations . The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time , or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance , has likewise been overturned ( e.g. , NGC 2808 ) . Further , the morphology of the cluster stars in a color @-@ magnitude diagram , and that includes the brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members , can be influenced by observational biases . One such effect is called blending , and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low @-@ resolution observations multiple ( unresolved ) stars may appear as a single target . Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star ( e.g. , an RR Lyrae variable ) is erroneously too bright , given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined . Consequently , the computed distance is wrong , and more importantly , certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder , and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant ."

By the early eighteenth century their education was expected to include basic literacy and numeracy , musical instruments ( including lute , viol and keyboard ) , needlework , cookery and household management , while polite accomplishments and piety were also emphasised . From the seventeenth century they were some notable aristocratic female writers . The first book written by a woman and published in Scotland was Elizabeth Melville 's Ane Godlie Dreame in 1603 . Later major figures included Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw ( 1627 – 1727 ) and Lady Grizel Baillie ( 1645 – 1746 ) .

They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice . As a result , many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics , and therefore were seen as unemotional , fell out of favor . One such instrument was the shawm . Bowed instruments such as the violin , viola , baryton , and various lutes dominated popular music . Beginning in around 1750 , however , the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the guitar . As the prevalence of string orchestras rose , wind instruments such as the flute , oboe , and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings ."

Kolbe also included an illustration , which Mohr believed was based on memory and notes . In 1975 A. M. Husson and L. B.

Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land ; their legal status is close to that of freemen . The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear . The names of common slaves show that some of them came from Kythera , Chios , Lemnos or Halicarnassus and were probably enslaved as a result of piracy . The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and freemen were common and that slaves could work and own land .

The report , which wholeheartedly supported racial segregation in schools and denounced the Supreme Court 's 1954 Brown decision , made a number of recommendations . Two stood out .

At times Culverhouse had to pay for fuel with his own credit card , because of McCullough ’ s financial difficulties . The offense was able to move the ball freely at times , but had difficulty getting the ball into the end zone . McKay and Spurrier had a difficult relationship , with Spurrier at times taking public potshots at McKay . Frustrated by the lack of quality receivers , Spurrier criticized McKay for playing his own son Johnny ahead of receivers Spurrier considered more capable . Coach McKay , for his part , questioned ( rightly , according to Spurrier himself ) Spurrier ’ s drive , although he publicly defended Spurrier by terming fans who booed him “ idiots ” . Spurrier was not the only player angered over the younger McKay ’ s retention , and Pat Toomay later alleged that Spurrier would throw passes over the middle to McKay in an attempt to get him injured , but that McKay made no effort to catch them .
