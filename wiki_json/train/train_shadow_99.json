Only 24 of the infantry were of European origin ; they were from the Madras Artillery . The rest of the infantry was composed of Indians employed by the British . The village of Koregaon was on the north bank of the river , which was shallow and narrow at this time of year . The village had a fortified enclosure constructed in the standard Maratha fashion . Stauton occupied the village but was unable to take the fortified enclosure , which was occupied by the Marathas . The British were cut off from the river , their only source of water . A fierce battle ensued that lasted the entire day . Streets and guns were captured and recaptured , changing hands several times . Baji Rao 's commander Trimabkji killed Lt. Chishom thereby avenging the death of Govindrao Gokhle , the only son of Bapu Gokhle . The Peshwa watched the battle from atop a nearby hill about two miles away . The Marathas evacuated the village and retreated during the night . This move on the part of the Marathas may seem justifiable because they were employing the tactics of Ganimi Kawa rather than Rangdi Maslat . The British lost 175 men and about a third of the irregular horse , with more than half of the European officers wounded . The Marathas lost 500 to 600 men . When the British found the village evacuated in the morning , Staunton took his battered troops and pretended to march on to Pune , but actually went to Shirur ."

Herring , now in command of New Guinea Force , ordered Savige to threaten the Japanese position at Salamaua ; the result was the Salamaua – Lae campaign . Despite the rugged conditions , Savige led from the front . He visited forward positions and flew over frontline areas wearing his scarlet general 's cap band to let his men — and any Japanese sniper — know that the general was on the job ."

In blackjack , the standard rule is that if the player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards , known as a pair , the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each . After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card . The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer . Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning . It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts . Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original .

What is known is that the \" Thomas set \" was commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas , who had also commissioned illustrations to Milton 's Comus and Paradise Lost from Blake . No contract for the commission is extant , but the commissioning probably took place in 1809 , which is the year in which the illustrations were completed . Blake was eager to accept the commission , according to G. E. Bentley , because \" Milton illustrations were a kind of work which Blake could not resist . \" They presumably stayed in the Revd Thomas 's family until they were bought at Sotheby 's from an anonymous seller in 1872 .

A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing , while Block II , the actual lunar spacecraft , would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development ."

The male may tease a female with the fish , not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently .

Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate ."

    "text": "Evolution may have played a role in the high rates of ADHD , particularly hyperactive and impulsive traits in males . Some have hypothesized that some women may be more attracted to males who are risk takers , increasing the frequency of genes that predispose to hyperactivity and impulsivity in the gene pool . Others have claimed that these traits may be an adaptation that helped males face stressful or dangerous environment with , for example , increased impulsivity and exploratory behavior . In certain situations , ADHD traits may have been beneficial to society as a whole even while being harmful to the individual . The high rates and heterogeneity of ADHD may have increased reproductive fitness and benefited society by adding diversity to the gene pool despite being detrimental to the individual . In certain environments , some ADHD traits may have offered personal advantages to individuals , such as quicker response to predators or superior hunting skills ."

After a rash of killings of lawyers and businessmen in 1974 , the government of Michael Manley attempted to restore order by granting broad new law enforcement powers in the Suppression of Crime Act and the Gun Court Act . The Suppression of Crime Act allowed the police and the military to work together in a novel way to disarm the people : soldiers sealed off entire neighbourhoods , and policemen systematically searched the houses inside for weapons without requiring a warrant . The goal was to expedite and improve enforcement of the 1967 Firearms Act , which imposed licensing requirements on ownership and possession of guns and ammunition , and prohibited automatic weapons entirely . Firearm licences in Jamaica require a background check , inspection and payment of a yearly fee , and can make legal gun ownership difficult for ordinary citizens .

They wanted these new characters to be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons . The team created consisted of Frank , Daniel Faraday , Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume , referred to as the \" freighter folk \" . Their relationship with the survivors of Flight 815 formed the crux of the fourth season . Co @-@ executive producer / writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name \" Lapidus \" for years , finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus . Unsatisfied , Kitsis developed the character \" Frank Lapidus , Helicopter Pilot \" . According to producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse , Jeff Fahey \" was the first and only choice for the role \" . Cuse had enjoyed Fahey 's roles in The Lawnmower Man and The Marshal , and he and Lindelof commended his \" intense eyes \" , stating that \" he has exactly the right sensibilities \" for the part . Fahey was offered the part without having to audition . At the time the producers began to consider him for the role , he had taken a break from acting and was living in Afghanistan , doing charity work and running an orphanage in Kabul . When Cuse contacted him about appearing in the show , Fahey was on the top of a mountain in Caracas , Venezuela during a rainstorm , having just opened an orphanage . He had never seen the series before , but the producers talked him through the first three seasons in an attempt to convince him to return to acting and accept the role . When he was cast , Fahey was unaware of whether he would be a guest star , or would develop into a regular . Focus on the character was diminished by the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , which resulted in the fourth season being cut short . The latter half of the season did feature the character more predominately , however some stories planned for Frank and his fellow freighter folk had to be deferred to the fifth season ."

The proposal met little support from the municipality , who wanted to prioritize Wyllerløypa , which was much cheaper to upgrade . Thus Rødkleiva was degraded to a training course . On 2 October 1986 the city council changed their opinion and granted funds for upgrading the hill . The upgrade would have given sufficient standard to allow FIS Alpine Ski World Cup events in slalom to be held and was part of a municipal strategy to market Oslo as a winter sports destination . In 1987 , a proposal was made for the Holmenkollen area to become a national arena for freestyle skiing , with Rødkleiva to be made into a permanent mogul course . The hill was taken over by Tryvann Ski Resort in 1988 . Plans to build a new ski lift which would connect with the other slopes were launched in November of that year . Rødkleiva was planned as the main competition hill for slalom and would regain its Olympics size . Det Norske Veritas withdrew Rødkleiva 's approval in October 1988 , especially noting the poor condition of the ski lift . The necessary upgrades would cost \" millions \" . In 1989 the municipality proposed building a replacement for Midtstubakken at Rødkleiva , which would serve as Oslo 's new normal hill as a supplement to the large Holmenkollbakken ."

Justice Joseph Story has expounded in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States that the disqualifying event expires at the conclusion of the elected term in which it occurred . This view is commonly accepted . Moreover , Department of Justice memoranda , outlining official opinions by United States Attorney General , hold that \" the Ineligibility Clause covers only increases during the term that a Member of Congress is [ or would be ] currently serving \" . This principle was applied , for example , to the question of whether President Clinton could appoint Representative Bill Richardson as Ambassador to the United Nations despite a salary increase prior to his current term , and whether President Harding could appoint Senator William Kenyon as a Judge despite the Congressional increase of judicial salaries during his previous term . Opinions issued by the Clinton administration Office of Legal Counsel often presupposed the application of the clause , and conceded that \" [ t ] he tradition of interpreting the Clause has been ' formalistic ' rather than ' functional ' \" . Another clarification came in 1969 , when newly re @-@ elected Representative Melvin Laird was President @-@ elect Nixon 's choice for Secretary of Defense and Congress was expected to raise the pay of Cabinet members in the new term .

At this point in the series , April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled . Shortly after the episode aired , HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy 's wedding registry . However , after \" Andy and April 's Fancy Party \" aired , Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode , but ran with \" Ron & Tammy : Part Two \" due to an error by NBC employees :"

Nearly eight hundred and fifty of its troops mutinied on the afternoon of the 15th , along with nearly a hundred men of the Malay States Guides . This mutiny lasted almost seven days , and resulted in the deaths of 47 British soldiers and local civilians . The mutineers also released the interned crew of the SMS Emden , who were asked by the mutineers to join them but refused and actually took up arms and defended the barracks after the mutineers had left ( sheltering some British refuges as well ) until the prison camp was relieved . The mutiny was suppressed only after French , Russian and Japanese ships arrived with reinforcements . Of 200 people tried at Singapore , 47 mutineers were shot in public executions , the rest were transported for life to East Africa . Most of the rest were deported for life or given jail terms ranging between seven and twenty years . In all 800 mutineers were either shot imprisoned or exiled Some historians , including Hew Strachan , argue that although Ghadar agents operated within the Singapore unit , the mutiny was isolated and not linked to the conspiracy . Others deem this as instigated by the Silk Letter Movement which became intricately related to the Ghadarite conspiracy ."

However keys found on Farrel matched a hire car later found in Marbella ( 80km away ) which was found to contain 64 kg of Semtex and detonators . An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the SAS had acted lawfully , while the European Court of Human Rights held that , although there had been no conspiracy , the planning and control of the operation was so flawed as to make the use of lethal force almost inevitable .

Sound change can consist of the replacement of one speech sound or phonetic feature by another , the complete loss of the affected sound , or even the introduction of a new sound in a place where there had been none . Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds .

On the other hand , sound changes can sometimes be sporadic , affecting only one particular word or a few words , without any seeming regularity .

The original consonant * bʰ became / b / in the Germanic languages , the previous * b in turn became / p / , and the previous * p became / f / . The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces , whereas Germanic languages , like English , have father and fish ."

In general , their densities increase when moving down the table , with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium . One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials : lithium 's value is anomalous , being more negative than the others . This is because the Li + ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase : though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly , causing a higher change in entropy , this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal , despite the difficulty of ionizing it in the gas phase ."

He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley , Earl of Southampton . In Venus and Adonis , an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus ; while in The Rape of Lucrece , the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin . Influenced by Ovid 's Metamorphoses , the poems show the guilt and moral confusion that result from uncontrolled lust . Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare 's lifetime . A third narrative poem , A Lover 's Complaint , in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor , was printed in the first edition of the Sonnets in 1609 . Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover 's Complaint . Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects . The Phoenix and the Turtle , printed in Robert Chester 's 1601 Love 's Martyr , mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover , the faithful turtle dove .

Amoebae are unicellular protists that separated from the tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants , and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells . Dictyostelium discoideum , for example , is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria . Like animal phagocytes , it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll @-@ like receptors , and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages . Dictyostelium discoideum is social ; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug . This multicellular organism eventually will produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers . Before the formation of fruiting bodies , the cells will migrate as a slug @-@ like organism for several days . During this time , exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens has the potential to compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production .

The statuary of the period consists for the most part of small terracotta figurines found at almost every Mycenaean site in mainland Greece , in tombs , in settlement debris , and occasionally in cult contexts ( Tiryns , Agios Konstantinos on Methana ) . The majority of these figurines are female and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic . The female figurines can be subdivided into three groups which were popular at different periods : the earliest are the Phi @-@ type , which look like the Greek letter phi and their arms give the upper body of the figurine a rounded shape . The Psi @-@ type looks like the letter Greek psi : these have outstretched upraised arms . The latest ( 12th century BC ) are the Tau @-@ type : these figurines look like the Greek letter tau with folded ( ? ) arms at right angles to the body . Most figurines wear a large ' polos ' hat . They are painted with stripes or zigzags in the same manner as the contemporary pottery and presumably made by the same potters . Their purpose is uncertain , but they may have served as both votive objects and toys : some are found in children 's graves but the vast majority of fragments are from domestic rubbish deposits . The presence of many of these figurines on sites where worship took place in the Archaic and Classical periods ( circa 200 below the sanctuary of Athena at Delphi , others at the temple of Aphaea on Aegina , at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas above Epidauros and at Amyklae near Sparta ) , suggests both that many were indeed religious in nature , perhaps as votives , but also that later places of worship may well have first been used in the Mycenaean period ."

Vampire bats are reproductively active year around , although the number of conceptions and births peak in the rainy season . Females give birth to one offspring per pregnancy , following a gestation period of about seven months . The young are raised primarily by the females . Mothers leave their young to hunt , and call their young to feed upon returning . The young accompany their mothers to hunt at six months , but are not fully weaned until nine months . Female offspring usually remain in their natal groups into adulthood , unless their mothers die or move . The occasional movements of unrelated females between groups leads to the formation of multiple matrilines within groups . Male offspring tend to live in their natal groups until they are one to two years old , sometimes being forced out by the resident adult males ."

He also recorded a mounting dissatifaction with the new rule , mentioning that peasants were especially upset by the continuous maneuvers of troops inside the Principalities ' borders .

The final impetus behind the road 's construction was primarily political . Borgo , along with the rest of the Papal States outside of the Vatican itself , was taken by the Kingdom of Italy during the Italian unification in the 19th Century – leading to Pope Pius IX 's declaration that he had become a prisoner in the Vatican and the formation of the Roman Question . For the next 59 years , the Popes refused to leave the Vatican , in order to avoid any appearance of accepting the authority wielded by the Italian government over Rome as a whole . Initially , parts of the Italian government welcomed this , expecting the influence of the Papacy to fade to the point that enough political support could be gained to abolish it altogether . However , this failed to come to pass , and eventually a compromise acceptable to both states was reached in the Lateran treaty of 1929 ."

The British Prime Minister minimised the political impact of the Chief Justice 's decision by presenting it as evidence that Beadle had furtively supported UDI all along , and subsequently excluded him from the diplomatic dialogue . Wilson pursued a second initiative which led to a fresh round of talks with Smith off Gibraltar aboard HMS Fearless in October 1968 . Marked progress towards agreement was made but the Rhodesian delegation demurred on a new British proposal , the \" double safeguard \" . This would involve elected black Rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in the Rhodesian parliament , with the power to veto retrogressive legislation , and thereafter having the right to appeal passed bills to the Privy Council in London . Smith 's team accepted the principle of the blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on the technicalities ; the involvement of the Privy Council was rejected by Smith as a \" ridiculous \" provision that would prejudice Rhodesia 's sovereignty . The talks ended without success ."

In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn – Langford – Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40 @,@ 000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River .

The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law .

Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems , and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product . Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autism 's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception . This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors . Just after birth , the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual , followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood . It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism . It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization . Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following :"

In order to make up for financial losses suffered since the panic of 1873 , the major railroads cut their employees ' wages several times in 1877 . In July of that year , workers from the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad walked off the job in Martinsburg , West Virginia , to protest their reduction in pay . The strike quickly spread to workers of the New York Central , Erie , and Pennsylvania railroads , with the strikers soon numbering in the thousands . Fearing a riot , Governor Henry M. Mathews asked Hayes to send federal troops to Martinsburg , and Hayes did so , but when the troops arrived there was no riot , only a peaceful protest . In Baltimore , however , a riot did erupt on July 20 and Hayes ordered the troops at Fort McHenry to assist the governor in its suppression ; by the time they arrived , the riot had dispersed . Pittsburgh next exploded into riots , but Hayes was reluctant to send in troops without the governor first requesting them . Other discontented citizens joined the railroad workers in rioting . After a few days , Hayes resolved to send in troops to protect federal property wherever it appeared to be threatened and gave Major General Winfield Scott Hancock overall command of the situation , marking the first use of federal troops to break a strike against a private company . The riot spread further , to Chicago and St. Louis , where strikers shut down railroad facilities . By July 29 , the riots had ended and federal troops returned to their barracks . Although no federal troops had killed any of the strikers , or been killed themselves , clashes between state militia troops and strikers resulted in deaths on both sides . The railroads were victorious in the short term , as the workers returned to their jobs and some wage cuts remained in effect . But , the public blamed the railroads for the strikes and violence , and they were compelled to improve working conditions and make no further cuts . Business leaders praised Hayes , but his own opinion was more equivocal ; as he recorded in his diary : \" The strikes have been put down by force ; but now for the real remedy . Can 't something [ be ] done by education of strikers , by judicious control of capitalists , by wise general policy to end or diminish the evil ? The railroad strikers , as a rule , are good men , sober , intelligent , and industrious . \""

Such circuits follow Kirchhoff 's circuit laws and possess a resistance and inductance . These circuits must generally be treated as a strongly coupled system , with the behavior in each plasma region dependent on the entire circuit . It is this strong coupling between system elements , together with nonlinearity , which may lead to complex behavior . Electrical circuits in plasmas store inductive ( magnetic ) energy , and should the circuit be disrupted , for example , by a plasma instability , the inductive energy will be released as plasma heating and acceleration . This is a common explanation for the heating that takes place in the solar corona . Electric currents , and in particular , magnetic @-@ field @-@ aligned electric currents ( which are sometimes generically referred to as \" Birkeland currents \" ) , are also observed in the Earth 's aurora , and in plasma filaments ."

Notwithstanding claims that the world would be better off if most adopted a single common lingua franca , such as English or Esperanto , there is a consensus that the loss of languages harms the cultural diversity of the world .

Moreover , moderationists suggest that the prohibitionist and abstentionist positions denigrate God 's creation and his good gifts and deny that it is not what goes into a man that makes him evil but what comes out ( that is , what he says and does ) . The Bible never uses the word ' wine ' of communion . Yet moderationists hold that in banishing wine from communion and dinner tables , prohibitionists and abstentionists go against the ' witness of the Bible ' and the church throughout the ages and implicitly adopt a Pharisaical moralism that is at odds with the what moderationists consider the right approach to biblical ethics and the doctrines of sin and sanctification ."

It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration . Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography . Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test and in the absence of this test the diagnosis must be made based on the clinical presentation of the patient . In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap . The patients ' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients ' measured sodium , glucose , blood urea nitrogen , and any ethanol that may have been ingested . The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning .

    "text": "Like many of Keats 's odes , \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" discusses art and art 's audience . He relied on depictions of natural music in earlier poems , and works such as \" Ode to a Nightingale \" appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual . Keats reverses this when describing an urn within \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" to focus on representational art . He previously used the image of an urn in \" Ode on Indolence \" , depicting one with three figures representing Love , Ambition and Poesy . Of these three , Love and Poesy are integrated into \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" with an emphasis on how the urn , as a human artistic construct , is capable of relating to the idea of \" Truth \" . The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities : an attempt at courtship , the making of music , and a religious rite . The figures are supposed to be beautiful , and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic . Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator , the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images . The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem , which creates ambiguity in the poem 's final lines : \" ' Beauty is truth , truth beauty , ' – that is all / Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . \" The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words , to whom they are speaking , and what is meant by the words , which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator ."

A common theme in supernatural anime , according to Martin , are souls discontent with their former lives , but the concept of Angel Beats ! is described as \" quite unusual \" because it features all the main characters as such souls and gathers them in one place . In the series , \" maintaining distinctiveness is essential for survival as an individual , \" which Martin calls a \" sly condemnation of the rigorous conformity impressed upon students by Japanese schooling . \" Overall , Angel Beats ! was lauded for \" requir [ ing ] no great familiarity with anime to enjoy . \""

While it had superior firepower , its sailing qualities were only average and they were slow under oars . It had the potential to be an effective weapon against galleys , matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament . Inside an enemy galley formation , it could wreak considerable havoc , but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle , leaving that tactical role untested . Like the hemmema , the turuma was effective in defensive formations , but lacked the mobility that was often needed in offensive archipelago warfare . In 1790 , after the war ended , two were converted into hospital ships . The second battle of Svensksund had clearly showed that the smaller and nimble gunboats and gunsloops were far more efficient in coastal warfare and had all but displaced \" archipelago frigates \" in the inshore squadrons by the Finnish War of 1808 – 09 ."

Although it appears that squab pie did originally contain pigeons , mutton and apples have been used as a substitute since at least 1737 using a recipe that has remained in cookbooks for years afterwards . This misnaming has meant that the pie is considered to be a surprise . Squab is described as tender with a mild berry flavour , and so it is possible that the combination of mutton and apples created a similar flavour .

This resulted in further conflict . The younger Henry rebelled again , but died of dysentery . Geoffrey died in 1186 after an accident in a tournament . In 1189 , Richard and Philip II of France reasserted their various claims exploiting the aging Henry 's failing health . Henry was forced to accept humiliating peace terms , including naming Richard his sole heir . The old King died two days later , defeated and miserable . French and English contemporary moralists viewed this fate as retribution for the murder of Becket ; even his favourite legitimate son , John , had rebelled although the constantly loyal illegitimate son Geoffrey remained with Henry until the end ."

The French Atlantic fleet , based at the fortified port of Brest in Brittany , was in a state of political turmoil during the early years of the war , suffering a mutiny in August 1793 , and then defeat at the battle of Glorious First of June in 1794 . In spite of these difficulties , the independent raiders caused considerable damage to British commerce , and in response the Admiralty ordered a squadron of frigates from the Channel Fleet to cruise the French coastline in search of these raiders . This force , known as the flying squadron and initially commanded by Sir John Borlase Warren , achieved a number of successes in the first year of the war , most notably in the Action of 23 April 1794 , when a French frigate squadron was destroyed ."

    "text": "In Great Britain , the philosophy of natural theology remained influential . William Paley 's 1802 book Natural Theology with its famous watchmaker analogy had been written at least in part as a response to the transmutational ideas of Erasmus Darwin . Geologists influenced by natural theology , such as Buckland and Sedgwick , made a regular practice of attacking the evolutionary ideas of Lamarck , Grant , and Vestiges . Although Charles Lyell opposed scriptural geology , he also believed in the immutability of species , and in his Principles of Geology , he criticized Lamarck 's theories of development . Idealists such as Louis Agassiz and Richard Owen believed that each species was fixed and unchangeable because it represented an idea in the mind of the creator . They believed that relationships between species could be discerned from developmental patterns in embryology , as well as in the fossil record , but that these relationships represented an underlying pattern of divine thought , with progressive creation leading to increasing complexity and culminating in humanity . Owen developed the idea of \" archetypes \" in the Divine mind that would produce a sequence of species related by anatomical homologies , such as vertebrate limbs . Owen led a public campaign that successfully marginalized Grant in the scientific community . Darwin would make good use of the homologies analyzed by Owen in his own theory , but the harsh treatment of Grant , and the controversy surrounding Vestiges , showed him the need to ensure that his own ideas were scientifically sound ."

Presumably one of his descendants adopted it as a surname before Blackadder II , in which the title character becomes \" Edmund Blackadder \" ."

Epikleroi ' were required to marry the nearest relative on their father 's side of the family , a system of inheritance known as the epiklerate . Although epikleros is often mistranslated as \" heiress \" , strictly speaking the terms are not equivalent , as the woman never owned the property and so was unable to dispose of it .

In this period he divided his time between his coffee plantation , his emancipation work and new political positions . In April 1954 , an incident that would showcase Boganda 's talent and appeal with crowds erupted at Berbérati . A white public works agent , who had recently been reprimanded for his brutality toward Africans , announced that his cook and the cook 's wife had died . A riot broke out and the governor sent in parachutists while armoured vehicles patrolled the streets . Boganda hesitated to appear in a village that was not one of his strongholds , but did so anyway and declared before the rioters that justice would be the same for blacks and whites . Upon hearing Boganda 's words , the crowd became calm and dispersed ."

    "text": "The notes accompanying the State Library 's acquisition of its punchbowl indicate that on 25 February 1926 , William Bowyer Honey , Keeper , Department of Ceramics , Victoria & Albert Museum , had appraised this particular punchbowl . Honey concluded that the bowl was made in China during Emperor Chia Ch 'ing 's reign in 1796 – 1820 . In 1757 , foreign trade had been restricted to Canton . Chinese exports , consisting largely of tea , porcelain and silk , had to be paid for in silver . The European ( and soon the American ) presence was restricted to the Thirteen Factories known as hongs on the harbour of Canton ( now known as Guangzhou ) . The Canton hongs themselves are frequently illustrated on punchbowls , known as hong bowls , whereas the portrayal of ports that traded with Canton – such as Sydney and New York – are extraordinarily rare . The Canton System lasted until the defeat of China 's Qing dynasty by the British Empire in the first of the Opium Wars in 1842 . Virtually no Chinese export porcelain was produced from 1839 to 1860 because of the Opium Wars . Canton hong trade was subsequently overshadowed by the rise of Hong Kong as a trading centre – territory ceded to the British as a consequence of China 's military defeats – and the subsequent establishment of 80 Treaty ports along China 's coast . The punchbowls therefore are a product made just before China 's eclipse , commissioned in Canton , where they were painted and glazed by Chinese ceramic artists . The unpainted bowls , however , would have first been manufactured in Jingdezhan , a town 800 km ( 500 mi ) by road from Canton , where pottery factories have operated for nearly 2 @,@ 000 years , and still do today ."

The tentacles are extremely sensitive and will bend toward the center of the leaf to bring the insect into contact with as many stalked glands as possible .

The outer tentacles ( recently coined as \" snap @-@ tentacles \" ) of D. burmannii and D. sessilifolia can bend inwards toward prey in a matter of seconds after contact , while D. glanduligera is known to bend these tentacles in toward prey in tenths of a second .

This appears to suggest that Shepseskare ruled after — rather than before — Neferefre . Verner 's second argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure , Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre : they form a line pointing to Heliopolis , just as the three pyramids of Giza do . In contrast , Shepseskare 's unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis , which strongly suggests that Neferefre 's pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started his . Finally , Verner observes that Neferefre is known to have been Neferirkare 's eldest son and around 20 years old when his father died so that he was in optimal position to inherit the throne . Shespeskare thus most likely took the throne after Neferefre . As Verner notes , while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara tablet , \" this slight discrepancy can ... be attributed to the [ political ] disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes . \""

It was meant to comply with the constitutional mandate of the Federal pact that presided over the Argentine Confederation , convening a Constitutional Assembly to meet in Santa Fe . This agreement was not accepted by the province of Buenos Aires , since it reduced its influence and power over the other provinces . Buenos Aires thereupon seceded from the confederation , thus Argentina got divided into two rival , independent states which fought to establish dominance . On the one side were the Federalists of the Argentine Confederation , led by Justo José de Urquiza . On the other , the Autonomists of Buenos Aires . The civil war was only brought to an end with the decisive victory of Buenos Aires over the Federation at the 1861 Battle of Pavón . The bonaerense liberal leader Bartolomé Mitre was elected the first President of a united Argentine Republic in 1862 ."

Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe . In addition to Spaniards , the invasion force probably included dozens of armed African slaves and freemen . The politically fragmented state of the Yucatán Peninsula at the time of conquest hindered the Spanish invasion , since there was no central political authority to be overthrown . However , the Spanish exploited this fragmentation by taking advantage of pre @-@ existing rivalries between polities . Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority , while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory . The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns , or reducciones ( also known as congregaciones ) . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish . Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases ; coastal reducciones , while convenient for Spanish administration , were also vulnerable to pirate attacks ."

Thus , it is one of only seven underground stations on the Flushing Line , one of three underground stations on the line in Queens , and the only underground station east of Queensboro Plaza . Construction of the station and the double @-@ deck bridge over the Flushing Creek began on April 21 , 1923 , with the station built via cut @-@ and @-@ cover methods . The bridge was completed in 1927 , and the station opened on January 21 , 1928 , over a decade after the line began operation ."

The removal of internal organs from three of the victims led to contemporary proposals that \" considerable anatomical knowledge was displayed by the murderer , which would seem to indicate that his occupation was that of a butcher or a surgeon . \" Media organisations and the police received many letters and postcards purportedly written by the killer , who was dubbed \" Jack the Ripper \" after one of the signatories .

It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that should be used for food , or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly . Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition .

The head is roughly triangular in shape and is loosely strung with mesh or leathers and nylon strings to form a \" pocket \" that allows the ball to be caught , carried , and thrown . In field lacrosse , the pocket of the crosse is illegal if the top of the ball , when placed in the head of the stick , is below the bottom of the stick 's sidewall . The head of a crosse may be 10 inches ( 25 cm ) in length . The maximum width of the head across the top is 4 to 10 inches ( 10 – 25 cm ) , for international competition , or 6 @.@ 5 to 10 inches ( 17 – 25 cm ) according to NCAA regulations . The NCAA instituted stricter specifications to ensure the \" safety and integrity of the game . \" As the shape of the crosse evolved , dislodging the ball from an opponent 's crosse became more difficult , and defenders used an increased amount of force when checking . The rule change was intended to reduce injuries , as defenders would need less forceful checks in order to dispossess opponents . Beginning January 1 , 2010 , measurements for the crosse shall include the following , in addition to current specifications :"

Robinson 's only other alternate history story prior to this project was the short story \" The Lucky Strike \" ( 1984 ) , where the Enola Gay crashes in a training exercise and the secondary crew must complete the Hiroshima bombing . Robinson also wrote an essay titled \" A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions \" ( 1991 ) , comparing different theories of history and laws of science , such as the covering law model , to explain how alternate histories can be arrived at , using \" The Lucky Strike \" as an example . He explored the idea of non @-@ Western influences creating a new culture while working on his Mars trilogy , which involved a heavy Muslim influence in a Martian colony .

An alternative was to obtain a \" private separation \" , an agreement negotiated between both spouses , embodied in a deed of separation drawn up by a conveyancer . Desertion or elopement was also possible , whereby the wife was forced out of the family home , or the husband simply set up a new home with his mistress .

The NHA had given the Wanderers the rights to Taylor in a dispersal of the Renfrew players . Trade talks were unfruitful . Ottawa , insistent in their claim for Taylor , played him in one game for Ottawa against the Wanderers . The Senators won the game ; however , Taylor was ineffectual .

Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies . Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money , the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market . Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate , arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent the loss of their cheap consumer and luxury goods . In 1963 , the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure , but were rebuffed ."

James Murray , born in India of English descent , was a businessman and manager of the Serampore paper mills who was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce .

Although most of their lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta , which was walled off from the indigenous sectors of the city , Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family 's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie . The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray 's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life , expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian .

Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality , Matthews pinpoints the G minor String Trio of 1894 ( unperformed until 1974 ) as the first underivative work produced by Holst . Matthews and Imogen Holst each highlight the \" Elegy \" movement in The Cotswold Symphony ( 1899 – 1900 ) as among the more accomplished of the apprentice works , and Imogen discerns glimpses of her father 's real self in the 1899 Suite de ballet and the Ave Maria of 1900 .

This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose , which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment .

Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift , cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said , \" Light leaves a galaxy , which is stationary in its local region of space , and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space . Between the galaxy and the observer , light travels through vast regions of expanding space . As a result , all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space . It is as simple as that ... \" Steven Weinberg clarified , \" The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of a ( t ) [ here a ( t ) is the Robertson @-@ Walker scale factor ] at the times of emission or absorption , but on the increase of a ( t ) in the whole period from emission to absorption . \""

The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him : often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches , but are sometimes factually unreliable . Frank Harris , his friend and editor , wrote a biography , Oscar Wilde : His Life and Confessions ( 1916 ) ; though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate , it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde . Lord Alfred Douglas wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde . Oscar Wilde and Myself ( 1914 ) , largely ghost @-@ written by T.W.H. Crosland , vindictively reacted to Douglas 's discovery that De Profundis was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde 's scandalous reputation .

Of Wilde 's other close friends , Robert Sherard , Robert Ross , his literary executor ; and Charles Ricketts variously published biographies , reminiscences or correspondence . The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when Hesketh Pearson wrote Oscar Wilde : His Life and Wit ( 1946 ) .

The Dark World is in fact Alefgard ( of the previous installments of the series ) , where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original Dragon Quest , including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff . Rubiss , a legendary sage , has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero , and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return .

Dr. J. H. Webb , a Kodak employee , studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States . He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible due to the timing of the events . A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks . Aware of the gravity of his discovery , Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949 ."

It may also encourage poor decisions and will damage bonds , which , in turn frequently escalates into a conflict over sole legal custody . Another criticism of having a joint legal custody arrangement is that it is a frequent occurrence for one parent to attempt to control the majority of decisions in the child 's life ( regardless of what the decree of joint legal custody states ) , which generally leads to conflict . Additionally , in a joint legal custody arrangement , if the parents of the children do not get along , this situation has the potential to cause parents to become combative and argue on every decision that needs to be made about their children , which can be extremely stressful for not only the children involved , but also for the parents ."

They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other . Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish . Osprey also have this adaptation . Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a 6 @.@ 8 kg ( 15 lb ) mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) fawn . This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird . It has been estimated that the gripping power ( pounds by square inch ) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human . Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight , but if the fish is too heavy to lift , the eagle may be dragged into the water . It may swim to safety , in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims , but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia . Many sources claim that bald eagles , like all large eagles , cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions . On numerous occasions , when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked , eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored , low flight over the water to a bank , where they then finish off and dismember the prey . When food is abundant , an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop . Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable . Occasionally , bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey , especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons , with one bird distracting potential prey , while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it . While hunting waterfowl , bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly , hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught ( white @-@ tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way ) . When hunting concentrated prey , a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully ."

This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass .

The financial demands of the Hundred Years ' War were enormous , and the king and his ministers tried different methods of covering the expenses . The king had a steady income from crown lands , and could also take up substantial loans from Italian and domestic financiers . To finance warfare on Edward III 's scale , however , the king had to resort to taxation of his subjects . Taxation took two primary forms : levy and customs . The levy was a grant of a proportion of all moveable property , normally a tenth for towns and a fifteenth for farmland . This could produce large sums of money , but each such levy had to be approved by parliament , and the king had to prove the necessity . The customs therefore provided a welcome supplement , as a steady and reliable source of income . An \" ancient duty \" on the export of wool had existed since 1275 . Edward I had tried to introduce an additional duty on wool , but this unpopular maltolt , or \" unjust exaction \" , was soon abandoned . Then , from 1336 onwards , a series of schemes aimed at increasing royal revenues from wool export were introduced . After some initial problems and discontent , it was agreed through the Ordinance of the Staple of 1353 that the new customs should be approved by parliament , though in reality they became permanent ."

In particular , the vowels varied in pronunciation depending upon their vowel length . Specific rules for consonants were provided in Appendix E of The Lord of the Rings , e.g. the letter c is always pronounced k , qu stands for kw , Orqui is Orkwi . Tolkien 's standard orthography for Quenya uses all the letters of the Latin script except j , k , and z , together with the acute and diaeresis marks on vowels ; the letters ñ , þ and z only appear in early Quenya . Occasionally , Tolkien wrote Quenya with a \" Finnish @-@ style \" orthography ( rather than the standard Latin @-@ Romance version ) , in which c is replaced by k , y with j , and long vowels written double ; .

Some viewers praised it , but others criticized the poor subtitles or the portrayal of police action against minorities . According to Libération , criticism was stronger in France than elsewhere . Lionhead 's selection of The French Democracy as a \" hot pick \" led to redistribution from other Internet sites , followed by coverage in mainstream media — including The Washington Post , BusinessWeek , USA Today , and Libération . The Washington Post and MTV originally created religious connotations by incorrectly labeling Chan 's characters as Muslims ; they issued corrected stories after Chan complained .

He spent several weeks in Parma working on these ; nevertheless , on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied . In the relevant section of Tasso 's poem , the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island . Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty , while Armida pleads with him to stay , or if he must depart , to allow her to be at his side in battle . When he refuses and abandons her , Armida curses him before falling insensible ."

The post of Superintendent of the Château de Malmaison gardens was given to the botanist Charles de Mirbel .

This garden was probably the most important collection of living Australian plants in Europe in this period . For several decades Delahaye was the only gardener in Europe who had actually seen the plants from New Holland growing in their natural habitat , and many of the plants he grew he had collected himself .

The mill was situated on an island in the middle of the river , with a weir and bypass channel to the north and the lock channel to the south . The Conservators were required to light the area after a boatman fell into the river and drowned while attempting to use the lock after dark in March 1826 . The coroner who instructed that the lighting should be installed noted that \" boats were passing at all hours of the night . \" Water levels in the river fell as more water was extracted further upstream , and by the 1890s the waterwheels were assisted by a steam @-@ driven turbine which the miller installed . Milling ceased in 1914 , when the boiler which supplied the steam was removed by the War Department , so that it could be fitted into a minesweeper . A surviving mill house which dates from the early 19th century has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building ."

Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates , art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising , the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808 – 14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814 . During the conflicts between Napoleon 's French Empire and Spain , Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers . Although deeply affected by the war , he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath . He was in poor health and almost deaf when , at 62 , he began work on the prints . They were not published until 1863 , 35 years after his death . It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons .

    "text": "Higinbotham designed a game that used an oscilloscope to display the path of a simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side . The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground . The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance . Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer , each consisting of a button and a knob . Pressing the button hit the ball , and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot . Originally , Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot , but decided it would make the controller too complicated . The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak . While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays , the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors , then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry . Excluding the oscilloscope and controller , the game 's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven ."

Secondary stability is different from the initial stabilization , because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant [ osseointegration ] . When this healing process is complete , the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability . Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximises mechanical and biological support of the implant . Regrowth usually occurs during the 3 – 4 weeks after implantation . Insufficient Primary stability , or high initial implant mobility , can cause failure ."

Dev 's partnership with Syed Kirmani set a world record for the largest ninth wicket stand of 126 .

This led to players such as Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid playing for India in later years ."

Westernization brought more independence for women and allowed some Japanese women to wear pants . The cognate tomboy is used in the Philippines , and particularly in Manila , to denote women who are more masculine . Virtuous women in Korea prioritize motherhood , chastity , and virginity ; outside of this scope , very few women are free to express themselves through sexuality , although there is a growing organization for lesbians named Kkirikkiri . The term pondan is used in Malaysia to refer to gay men , but since there is no historical context to reference lesbians , the term is used for female homosexuals as well . As in many Asian countries , open homosexuality is discouraged in many social levels , so many Malaysians lead double lives ."

One such way is if it moves over land , thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself , quickly losing strength . Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure within a day or two , or evolve into extratropical cyclones . There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water , such as with Hurricane Ivan . If it remains over mountains for even a short time , weakening will accelerate . Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain , when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall . This may lead to deadly floods and mudslides , as was the case with Hurricane Mitch in 1998 . Without warm surface water , the storm cannot survive ."

Thus it became known as Tibicen curvicostus , and Abricta curvicosta from 1906 . French entomologist Jean Baptiste Boisduval described two specimens collected from Port Jackson as Cicada tephrogaster ( later Tibicen tephrogaster ) in 1835 ; this has long been considered a junior synonym . However , a review of the genus in 2003 showed Abricta to be a disparate group of species , and the Australian members were moved to other genera . Max Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region . Of the 15 Australian species , the floury baker was the earliest offshoot . Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14 species , and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta , while most of the others were placed in the genus Tryella . The morphological distinction between Aleeta and Tryella is based on two factors : A. curvicosta has a larger forewing size – rarely less than 3 @.@ 2 cm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) and usually over 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) , whereas Tryella is never above 3 @.@ 2 cm ( 1 @.@ 3 in ) ; the uncal lobes of Aleeta 's distinctive male genitalia are downturned at their distal ends , whereas those of Tryella are upturned .

When World War I began in August 1914 , she was commanded by Captain Kanji Katō . The ship was ordered to Singapore and cooperated with the British to hunt down the light cruiser Emden in the East Indies and Indian Ocean . Ibuki was ordered to New Zealand to escort a large troop convoy of ANZAC troops to the Middle East in late September . She was ordered to guard the convoy , over Katō 's protests , when the presence of the Emden was discovered in the Cocos Islands on 9 November . The Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney was detached from the convoy to sink the Emden instead . With the ending of the threat to the convoy , Ibuki was transferred to the Second South Seas Squadron at Truk in the Caroline Islands . She was refitted at Kure in 1918 , disarmed in 1922 , and stricken from the Navy List the following year and scrapped in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty ."

Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane , but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a hypothetical protein known as scramblase . These molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells that possess the appropriate receptors , such as macrophages . The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an inflammatory response and is an important function of phagocytes ."

The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia .

Precipitation is low ( most of Antarctica is a desert ) and almost always in the form of snow , which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land . Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams , which flow towards the edges of the continent . Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves . These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass . Offshore , temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year .

Most Royal Maundy ceremonies in the first part of the century were attended by Princess Helena or by her daughter Princess Marie Louise .

King George did so in 1932 , the only time he was at the service during his reign . In 1936 , the year of King George 's death , the new king , Edward VIII made the distribution . George VI ( who succeeded King Edward on his abdication late in 1936 ) did not attend until 1940 , and then not again until 1944 , his place being taken in most years by the Lord High Almoner , Cosmo Gordon Lang , Archbishop of Canterbury .

From the above discussion , only one percent of the energy needs to be transferred to produce an explosion , but explaining how that one percent of transfer occurs has proven very difficult , even though the particle interactions involved are believed to be well understood . In the 1990s , one model for doing this involved convective overturn , which suggests that convection , either from neutrinos from below , or infalling matter from above , completes the process of destroying the progenitor star . Heavier elements than iron are formed during this explosion by neutron capture , and from the pressure of the neutrinos pressing into the boundary of the \" neutrinosphere \" , seeding the surrounding space with a cloud of gas and dust which is richer in heavy elements than the material from which the star originally formed ."

Before then , teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time . In 1887 , four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) and developed a structured schedule . In 1892 , Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup to be symbolic of the Canadian championship and appointed Philip Dansken Ross and Sheriff John Sweetland as its trustees . It was awarded to the AHAC champion Montreal Hockey Club and thereafter awarded to the league champions , or to any pre @-@ approved team that won it in a challenge . In 1904 , the International Hockey League ( IHL ) , based around Lake Michigan , was created as the first fully professional league , which lasted for two seasons . In recruiting players , the IHL caused an \" Athletic War \" that drained amateur clubs of top players , most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) . In the 1905 – 06 season , the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) was formed , which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters , which led to the demise of the IHL . Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money , and it eventually folded on November 25 , 1909 . As a result of the dissolution of the ECAHA , two leagues were formed — the Canadian Hockey Association ( CHA ) and the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . Since the NHA 's owners were notable , wealthy businessmen , the CHA did not complete a season , as the NHA easily recruited the top players , and interest in the CHA teams faded . By 1914 , the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) league was launched and the NHA champion would play off each season against the PCHA champion for the Stanley Cup , ending the challenge era ."

In 962 Ildulb mac Causantín , King of Scots , was killed ( according to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba ) fighting the Norse near Cullen , at the Battle of Bauds , and although there is no evidence of permanent Viking settlement on the east coast of Scotland south of the Moray Firth , raids and even invasions certainly occurred .

The long @-@ ship , the key to their success , was a graceful , long , narrow , light , wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed .

Eric Ives , a British historian and legal expert , advocates the 1501 date , while Retha Warnicke , an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne , prefers 1507 . The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514 . She wrote it in French to her father , who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen , in the Burgundian Netherlands , now Belgium . Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen at the time of its composition , while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child . In Ives 's view , this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour , as Anne was to the regent , Margaret of Austria . This is supported by claims by a chronicler from the late 16th century , who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France .

This view , which originated with feudal jurists in the thirteenth century , was held to by modern historians since the early thirties . Through the work of Prawer , particularly his two papers from the fifties , and his colleagues , crusader society began to be seen as dynamic , with the nobility gradually putting checks on the monarchy . The combined efforts of these historians led to a surge of new research into crusader society . Prawer 's research extended to a wide variety of other aspects of the crusader states . Among the topics he addressed were land development projects and urban settlement , agriculture , the Italian quarters of port cities , the types of landed property , and legal issues in the Assises des Bourgeois ."

Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s . These recordings were supervised by Rupert D 'Oyly Carte .

Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot . A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret through a set of gears ; a full rotation was made in 22 @.@ 5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862 . Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made . The only way to see out of the turret was through the gun ports ; when the guns were not in use , or withdrawn for reloading during battle , heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports . Including the guns , the turret weighed approximately 160 long tons ( 163 t ) ; the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate . The spindle was 9 inches ( 23 cm ) in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways . When not in use , the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal . In service , however , this proved to leak heavily , despite caulking by the crew . The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several Passaic @-@ class monitors , which used the same turret design , during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle , which could also jam the turret . To gain access to the turret from below , or to hoist up powder and shot during battle , the turret had to rotate facing directly to starboard , which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below . The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship 's guns and to improve ventilation , with only gravity holding the roof plates in place ."

The first area of the city to receive the service was Downtown Minneapolis , though it was delayed two weeks there due to technical challenges posed by the skyscrapers in the area , as well as the uneven terrain of the Mississippi River on the east side of the area . The goal was to blanket the entire city with the network by November 2007 and in spite of delays , USI Wireless expected that the next area for installation , a residential neighborhood , would be easier thanks to its flat terrain . In late 2008 , however , the completion of the network was stuck at 82 % because of a misunderstanding between the Minneapolis Park Board , who stated that USI Wireless could not install their radio transmitters on park land without the proper permits , and USI Wireless , who had been unaware of this .

Apart from a few short @-@ term seismic monitoring experiments by the Geological Survey of Canada , no volcano monitoring has been accomplished at the Silverthrone Caldera or at other volcanoes in Canada at a level approaching that in other established countries with historically active volcanoes . Active or restless volcanoes are usually monitored using at least three seismographs all within approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) , and frequently within 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) , for better sensitivity of detection and reduced location errors , particularly for earthquake depth .

Currently the Silverthrone Caldera does not have a seismograph closer than 124 kilometres ( 77 mi ) . With increasing distance and declining numbers of seismographs used to indicate seismic activity , the prediction capability is reduced because earthquake location and depth measurement accuracy decreases . The inaccurate earthquake locations in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt are a few kilometers , and in more isolated northern regions they are up to 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) .

He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him , as well as two secular priests , Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole ( also known as Smith ) , the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England . The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers , being only marginally productive ; as the summer climate was deceptively mild , his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony ."

    "text": "In 2011 , Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which Deinonychus and other dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey . This model , known as the \" raptor prey restraint \" ( RPR ) model of predation , proposes that Deinonychus killed its prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey : by leaping onto its quarry , pinning it under its body weight , and gripping it tightly with the large , sickle @-@ shaped claws . Like accipitrids , the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive , until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure . This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors . Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks , especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion . However , the short metatarsus and foot strength would have been more similar to that of owls . The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of Deinonychus 's anatomy , such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology . The arms were likely covered in long feathers , and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal , along with the stiff counterbalancing tail . Its jaws , thought to have had a comparatively weak bite force , might be used for saw motion bites , like the modern Komodo dragon which also has a weak bite force , to finish off its prey if its kicks weren 't powerful enough ."

The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe . After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia , both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuk Turks . The main Western Christian source , Odo of Deuil , and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos secretly hindered the crusaders ' progress , particularly in Anatolia , where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them . Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and participated in 1148 in an ill @-@ advised attack on Damascus . The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the Muslims . It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century ."

    "text": "Sir Nathaniel Curzon , later 1st Baron Scarsdale , commissioned Brettingham in 1759 to design a great country house . Thirty years before a prospective design for a new Kedleston Hall had been drawn up by James Gibbs , one of the leading architects of the day , but Curzon wanted his new house to match the style and taste of Holkham . Lord Leicester , Holkham 's owner and Brettingham 's employer , was a particular hero of Curzon 's . Curzon was a Tory from a very old Derbyshire family , and he wished to create a showpiece to rival the nearby Chatsworth House owned by the Whig Duke of Devonshire , whose family were relative newcomers in the county , having arrived little more than two hundred years earlier . However , the Duke of Devonshire 's influence , wealth , and title were far superior to Curzon 's , and Curzon was unable to complete his house or to match the Devonshires ' influence ( William Cavendish , 4th Duke of Devonshire , had been Prime Minister in the 1750s ) . This commission might have been the ultimate accolade Brettingham was seeking , to recreate Holkham but this time with full credit . Kedleston Hall was designed by Brettingham on a plan by Palladio for the unbuilt Villa Mocenigo . The design by Brettingham , similar to that of Holkham Hall , was for a massive principal central block flanked by four secondary wings , each a miniature country house , themselves linked by quadrant corridors . From the outset of the project , Curzon seems to have presented Brettingham with rivals . In 1759 , while Brettingham was still supervising the construction of the initial phase , the northeast family block , Curzon employed architect James Paine , the most notable architect of the day , to supervise the kitchen block and quadrants . Paine also went on to supervise the construction of Brettingham 's great north front . However , this was a critical moment for architecture in England . Palladianism was being challenged by a new taste for neoclassical designs , one exponent of which was Robert Adam . Curzon had met Adam as early as 1758 , and had been impressed by the young architect newly returned from Rome . He employed Adam to design some garden pavilions for the new Kedleston . So impressed was Curzon by Adam 's work that by April 1760 he had put Adam in sole charge of the design of the new mansion , replacing both Brettingham and Paine . Adam completed the north facade of the mansion much as Brettingham had designed it , only altering Brettingham 's intended portico . The basic layout of the house remained loyal to Brettingham 's original plan , although only two of the proposed four secondary wings were executed ."

    "text": "The six decades from around 1870 to 1930 saw a redoubling of Austen 's international renown , with translations of her works into other languages ( including French , German , Danish and Swedish ) and three biographical studies and analyses of her literary themes . In 1869 the first significant Austen biography ( A Memoir of Jane Austen by her nephew , James Edward Austen @-@ Leigh ) was published , and her popularity and critical standing increased dramatically . Readers of the Memoir were presented with the myth of an amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces ; it fixed in the public mind a sentimental image of Austen as a quiet , middle @-@ aged maiden aunt whose work was appropriate for a respectable Victorian family . Austen @-@ Leigh commissioned a portrait of Austen , based on an earlier watercolour , which softened her image for the Victorian public . Richard Bentley 's engraving , the Memoir 's frontispiece , is based on this idealised image . The Memoir sparked a revival of Austen 's novels . The first popular editions ( an economical , sixpenny series published by Routledge ) were published in 1883 . This was followed by elaborate illustrated editions , collectors ' sets and scholarly editions . Contemporary critics continued to assert that Austen 's works were sophisticated , capable of enjoyment only by those who could plumb their depths . However , more criticism of Austen 's novels was published in the two years following the Memoir than had appeared in the previous fifty . Austen descendants William Austen @-@ Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen @-@ Leigh published the definitive family biography , Jane Austen : Her Life and Letters — A Family Record , in 1913 . Based primarily on family papers and letters , it was described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \" accurate , staid , reliable , and at times vivid and suggestive \" . The authors distanced themselves from the Memoir 's sentimental tone , making little effort to go beyond immediately available family records and traditions , and their book offers facts with little interpretation ."

The majority of simple chalcogen halides are well @-@ known and widely used as chemical reagents . However , more complicated chalcogen halides , such as sulfenyl , sulfonyl , and sulfuryl halides , are less well @-@ known to science . Out of the compounds consisting purely of chalcogens and halogens , there are a total of 13 chalcogen fluorides , nine chalcogen chlorides , eight chalcogen bromides , and six chalcogen iodides that are known . The heavier chalcogen halides often have significant molecular interactions . Sulfur fluorides with low valences are fairly unstable and little is known about their properties . However , sulfur fluorides with high valences , such as sulfur hexafluoride , are stable and well @-@ known . Sulfur tetrafluoride is also a well @-@ known sulfur fluoride . Certain selenium fluorides , such as selenium difluoride , have been produced in small amounts . The crystal structures of both selenium tetrafluoride and tellurium tetrafluoride are known . Chalcogen chlorides and bromides have also been explored . In particular , selenium dichloride and sulfur dichloride can react to form organic selenium compounds . Dichalcogen dihalides , such as Se2Cl2 also are known to exist . There are also mixed chalcogen @-@ halogen compounds . These include SeSX , with X being chlorine or bromine . Such compounds can form in mixtures of sulfur dichloride and selenium halides . These compounds have been fairly recently structurally characterized , as of 2008 . In general , diselenium and disulfur chlorides and bromides are useful chemical reagents . Chalcogen halides with attached metal atoms are soluble in organic solutions . One example of such a compound is MoS2Cl3 . Unlike selenium chlorides and bromides , selenium iodides have not been isolated , as of 2008 , although it is likely that they occur in solution . Diselenium diiodide , however , does occur in equilibrium with selenium atoms and iodine molecules . Some tellurium halides with low valences , such as Te2Cl2 and Te2Br2 , form polymers when in the solid state . These tellurium halides can be synthesized by the reduction of pure tellurium with superhydride and reacting the resulting product with tellurium tetrahalides . Ditellurium dihalides tend to get less stable as the halides become lower in atomic number and atomic mass . Tellurium also forms iodides with even fewer iodine atoms than diiodies . These include TeI and Te2I . These compounds have extended structures in the solid state . Halogens and chalcogens can also form halochalcogenate anions ."

Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly anthropomorphic sense similar to voluntary \" endeavoring \" or \" struggling \" to achieve certain ends , and medieval Scholastic philosophers developed a notion of conatus as a mysterious intrinsic property of things , Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more mechanistic sense . More specifically , for Descartes , in contrast to Buridan , movement and stasis are two states of the same thing , not different things . Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes ' notion of conatus , one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view ."

As a child , she confused her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family seen in the cartoons of Charles Addams . Bruce Bechdel 's suicide is discussed with reference to Albert Camus ' novel A Happy Death and essay The Myth of Sisyphus . His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to The Great Gatsby by F.

His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the Henry James novels Washington Square and The Portrait of a Lady . Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress , and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage . She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of The Taming of the Shrew , and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was \" a harbinger of my parents ' later marriage \" .
