Alvarado 's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs , and included cavalry and artillery ; he was accompanied by a great many indigenous allies . Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco , and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown . They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish . By 1524 , Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces . Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony , the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards . As a result , the inhabitants of Soconusco were less likely to be rounded up into new reducción settlements than elsewhere in Chiapas , since the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature ."

    "text": "When Gervase Markham published his Cavalarice , or the English Horseman in 1617 , farmers were not only using pack horses , farm horses and cart horses , but were also breeding horses for saddling and driving . Markham recommended crossing native horses with other breeds for particular purposes , for example suggesting Turks or Irish Hobbies as an outcross to produce riding animals , Friesland and Flanders horses to produce light driving animals , and German heavy draught horses to produce heavy haulage animals . Horse fairs were numerous , and some of the earliest mentions of specific breeds , such as Cleveland horses and Suffolk Punch horses , date from this time . Large Dutch horses were imported by King William III ( 1650 – 1702 ) when he discovered that existing cart horses did not have the strength for the task of draining the Fens . These horses became known as Lincolnshire Blacks , and the English heavy draught horses of today are their descendants . By the middle of the 17th century , the reputation of the British horse throughout Europe had become so good that , according to Sir Jonas Moore in 1703 , \" since the peace treaty with France , farmers had been offered by Frenchmen three times the accustomed price for their horses \" ."

During a speech in support of the First Naval Law on 6 December 1897 , Tirpitz stated that the navy was \" a question of survival \" for Germany . He also viewed Great Britain , with its powerful Royal Navy , as the primary threat to Germany . In a discussion with the Kaiser during his first month in his post as State Secretary , he stated that \" for Germany the most dangerous naval enemy at present is England . \" Tirpitz theorized that an attacking fleet would require a 33 percent advantage in strength to achieve victory , and so decided that a 2 : 3 ratio would be required for the German navy . For a final total of 60 German battleships , Britain would be required to build 90 to meet the 2 : 3 ratio envisioned by Tirpitz ."

It can be inferred from Tacitus ' description in Germania that his \" Venethi \" lived possibly around the middle Dnieper basin , which in his times would correspond to the Proto @-@ Slavic Zarubintsy cultural sphere . Jordanes , to whom the Venethi meant his contemporary Slavs , wrote of past fighting between the Ostrogoths and the Venethi , which took place during the third quarter of 4th century in today 's Ukraine . At that time the Venethi would therefore mean the Kiev culture people . The Venethi says Jordanes , who \" now rage in war far and wide , in punishment for our sins \" , were at that time made obedient to the Gothic king Hermanaric 's command . Jordanes ' 6th @-@ century description of the \" populous race of the Venethi \" range includes the regions near the left ( northern ) ridge of the Carpathian Mountains and stretching from there \" almost endlessly \" east , while in the western direction reaching the sources of the Vistula . More specifically he designates the area between the Vistula and the lower Danube as the country of the Sclaveni . \" They have swamps and forests for their cities \" ( hi paludes silvasque pro civitatibus habent ) , he adds sarcastically . The \" bravest of these peoples \" , the Antes , settled the lands between the Dniester and the Dnieper rivers . The Venethi were the third Slavic branch of an unspecified location ( the more distant from Jordanes ' vantage and more ancestral in relation to the other two , the Kolochin culture is the likely possibility ) , as well as the overall designation for the totality of the Slavic peoples , who \" though off @-@ shoots from one stock , have now three names \" . Procopius in De Bello Gothico located the \" countless Antes tribes \" even further east , beyond the Dnieper . Together with the Sclaveni they spoke the same language , of an \" unheard of barbarity \" . According to him the Heruli nation traveled in 512 across all of the Sclaveni peoples territories , and then west of there through a large expanse of unpopulated lands , as the Slavs were about to settle the western and northern parts of Poland in the decades to follow .

Initially , his writings , titled Moldavian Stories , formed part of the Soviet curriculum in the Moldavian Autonomous Region ( Transnistria ) . Following the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia , Creangă was one of the Romanian @-@ language writers whose works were still allowed for publishing by the new authorities . This provided local contributors to Romanian literature contact with older cultural models , directly inspiring the experimental or Postmodern prose pieces by Vlad Ioviță and Leo Butnaru . The endorsement of Creangă 's public image within the Moldavian SSR was also reflected in art : in 1958 , the writer 's bust , the work of sculptor Lev Averbruh , was assigned to the Alley of Classics in Chișinău . His works were illustrated by one of the Moldavian SSR 's leading visual artists , Igor Vieru , who also painted a portrait of the author . In 1967 , Ioviță and filmmaker Gheorghe Vodă released Se caută un paznic : an adaptation of \" Ivan Turbincă \" and one of the successful samples of early Moldovan cinema , it was also noted for the musical score , composed by Eugen Doga . Also during that period , \" The Goat ... \" and \" The Purse a ' Tuppence \" were made into animated shorts ( directed by Anton Mater and Constantin Condrea ) .

Two members are a part of this tribe , the extant Nothomyrmecia and the extinct Prionomyrmex . The tribe was once considered a subfamily due to the similarities between Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex , but such reclassification was not widely accepted by the scientific community . These ants can be identified by their long slender bodies , powerful stingers and elongated mandibles . Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants were once found throughout Europe , possibly nesting in trees and preferring jungle habitats . Today , Prionomyrmecini is only found in Australia , preferring old @-@ growth mallee woodland surrounded by Eucalyptus trees . Nothomyrmecia workers feed on nectar and arthropods , using their compound eyes for prey and navigational purposes . Owing to their primitive nature , they do not recruit others to food sources or create pheromone trails . Nothomyrmecia colonies are small , consisting of 50 to 100 individuals ."

For instance , an esoteric fraternal organization in Napoleonic France , the Sophisian Order , regarded Isis as their tutelary deity . To them , she symbolized both modern scientific knowledge — which hoped to uncover Nature 's secrets — and the mystical wisdom of the ancient mystery rites . The vague set of esoteric beliefs that surrounded the goddess offered an alternative to traditional Christianity . It was during this anticlerical era that Dupuis claimed that Christianity was a distorted offshoot of ancient mystery cults ."

However , a specimen of Daspletosaurus ( OTM 200 ) from the contemporaneous Two Medicine Formation of Montana preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region . Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs , neither genus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other .

Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana and in southwestern North America during the Campanian , while centrosaurines and lambeosaurines dominate in northern latitudes .

Many other historians trace Chrysostom and Leontius ' accounts back to Eusebius : Hans Pohlsander counts Chrysostom and Leontius ' accounts as later accretions to Eusebius original account , dependent on his Historia for their legendary core ; John Gregg holds that this dependent relationship is most probable ; and Stein claims all three Greeks as contributors to the same gerüchte ."

This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions , while increasing their individual strength . Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure , reasoning that the number of battalions , rather than their relative strength , was the overriding factor when considering potential overseas deployments . The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961 . In October 1964 , Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation . In the meantime , as a response to the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , the Australian government reintroduced conscription , which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments . Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery , and vice versa ; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that \" it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier \" , he wrote on it \" This assumption not justified \" . In February – March 1965 , following a request from the Malaysian government , Australia despatched 1 Squadron , Special Air Service Regiment , and 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment , to Borneo — a commitment Wilton felt able to recommend as a result of the recent decisions to increase the Army 's personnel and battalion numbers ."

The plectrum can move forwards with little resistance ; but moving it backwards makes it catch each tooth , setting up a vibration in both wings .

G. gryllotalpa can deliver a peak sound pressure of 72 decibels and a mean of about 66 decibels .

As a first year apprentice he played for the youth and reserve teams and due to his great goalscoring record , which led to him being named on the bench for two first team matches in the League Cup , they decided to keep him on for a third year . As a third year apprentice he scored 15 goals for the club 's reserve and youth team . This led to him to being loaned out to Kidderminster Harriers of the Conference National in November 2005 to play first team football . He made his debut for Kidderminster after coming on as an 86th minute substitute in a 3 – 1 defeat to Stevenage Borough . He converted a Simon Heslop cross during a match against Dagenham & Redbridge to score his first career goal , which helped Kidderminster to a 3 – 1 victory . Also , during a match he displayed a smart piece of skill which involved flicking the ball over an opponents head with his heel , then crossing the ball in for a teammate to score ; this move was featured on Soccer AM 's showboating section ."

The Ottoman era waterfront houses ( yalı ) on the Bosphorus also reflect the fusion between classical Ottoman and European architectural styles during the aforementioned period . The First National Architectural Movement ( Birinci Ulusal Mimarlık Akımı ) in the early 20th century sought to create a new architecture , which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture . The movement was also labelled Turkish Neoclassical or the National Architectural Renaissance . The leading architects of this movement were Vedat Tek ( 1873 – 1942 ) , Mimar Kemaleddin Bey ( 1870 – 1927 ) , Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu ( 1888 – 1982 ) and Giulio Mongeri ( 1873 – 1953 ) . Notable buildings from this era are the Grand Post Office in Istanbul ( 1905 – 1909 ) , Tayyare Apartments ( 1919 – 1922 ) , Istanbul 4th Vakıf Han ( 1911 – 1926 ) , State Art and Sculpture Museum ( 1927 – 1930 ) , Ethnography Museum of Ankara ( 1925 – 1928 ) , the first Ziraat Bank headquarters in Ankara ( 1925 – 1929 ) , the first Türkiye İş Bankası headquarters in Ankara ( 1926 – 1929 ) , Bebek Mosque , and Kamer Hatun Mosque ."

Contemporaries attributed this to the effects of overwork , which had certainly taken its toll , but there were also other aspects ; Newall had lost political support , particularly following a dispute with Lord Beaverbrook over the control of aircraft production and repair . Matters came to a head with the circulation of an anonymous memo attacking Newall , among other senior officers , as \" a real weakness to the RAF and to the nation 's defences \" . The author was Edgar McCloughry , a disaffected staff officer who saw himself as passed over for promotion and who had been brought into Beaverbrook 's inner circle . Beaverbrook pressed Churchill to dismiss Newall , gaining the support of influential ex @-@ RAF figures such as Trenchard and Salmond . Trenchard had come out against Newall for his failure to launch a decisive strategic bombing offensive , while Salmond saw Newall 's removal as the simplest way to replace Dowding as head of Fighter Command – despite Newall having also sought to sack Dowding ."

It opened in 1837 , after proposals had been made for more direct routes in 1830 and 1835 . The earlier schemes attracted little interest , but two proposals were put forward in late 1835 . The two companies , based in Manchester and Birmingham , had to negotiate with each other to develop the proposals , and they were altered somewhat over the next two years . In 1837 Parliament approved the final plans for lines to Crewe and Stoke . The companies merged to become the Manchester and Birmingham Railway company , and the first part of the line opened in June 1840 . It originally ran from a temporary station at Travis Street in Manchester , to a station in Heaton Norris just north of Stockport . A large viaduct was built over the River Mersey , and opened to trains on 10 May 1842 . It allowed services to be extended to Sandbach ; in the following August they reached Crewe . Also at this time , a new station opened to serve as the line 's northern terminus ; it later became Manchester Piccadilly . Edgeley railway station opened in February 1843 in response to complaints that the Heaton Norris station was \" too inconvenient \" , and it soon became Stockport 's busiest station . Three years later in 1846 the Manchester and Birmingham Railway company merged with two other companies to become the London and North Western Railway ."

    "text": "As of April 2008 , 38 species are considered by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction . Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor large enough to be hunted ; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is habitat loss . The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds . The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads . If these species become locally extinct in a fragment , this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re @-@ establishment unlikely . Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed @-@ species feeding flocks , leading to local extinctions . Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation . An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island , a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal . Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated , in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island . While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened , they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species . The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges . Some are also extremely poorly known ; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982 , although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered . Additionally , new species are discovered at regular intervals ; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000 , the acre antshrike in 2004 , the sincorá antwren in 2007 , and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared . While not yet scientifically described , conservation efforts have already been necessary , as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir . Consequently , 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality ."

The jury deliberated for a few hours and ended up as a hung jury so the case was dismissed . In 1858 , the Committee on Commerce of the United States House of Representatives conducted an investigation to decide if the Rock Island Bridge was a serious obstruction to the navigation of the river . The committee concluded that the bridge was a hazard because of the length of the pier , the angle of the bridge , and the swift current under the bridge . The committee believed , however , that the courts should settle the matter and therefore did not recommend any action by the United States Congress . In May 1858 , Ward filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa asking the court to declare the bridge a nuisance and order its removal and restore the river to its original capacity for all purposes of navigation . The judge declared the bridge a nuisance and ordered the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad to remove the three piers and their superstructure that lay on the Iowa side . The judge reasoned that if this bridge was not stopped , many other bridges would follow . The piers were not torn out , because the railroad company appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court . The Supreme Court , reversed the decision of the district court and allowed the bridge to remain ."

A number of British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe . The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and , if possible , extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination . Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the installation from a seaborne raid , it was believed that a Commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set . It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation , seize the technology intact , and minimise casualties to the raiding force ."

In 1100 the new king , Henry I , granted William \" his demesne in the Peak \" . Thus the Peak became an independent lordship under William Peveril 's control , and the castle became an important centre of administration for the area , allowing the collection of taxes . Castleton benefited from the castle 's new status and began to grow as the lordship 's economic heart . William Peveril died in 1114 and was succeeded by his son , William Peveril the Younger . In the civil war known as The Anarchy between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda , Peveril backed the losing side and his fortunes suffered after his capture at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141 . In 1153 Peveril was suspected of attempting to poison Ranulf de Gernon , 4th Earl of Chester . In 1153 the future King Henry II accused Peveril of \" plundering and treachery \" and threatened to confiscate his estates and hand them over to the Earl of Chester . Two years later Henry , now king , followed through his threat . The Earl of Chester was dead by this time , and the king kept the property for himself .

When Justin II recalled his cousin to Constantinople , it seemed that this was the reason . The general was warmly received at first , but soon the new emperor began to make accusations against him , dismissed his bodyguard and placed him under house arrest , before sending him to exile in Alexandria , ostensibly as the new augustal prefect of Egypt . There , he was murdered in his sleep , ostensibly because he was plotting to seize the throne , and his head was cut off and brought to Constantinople .

Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk , sharing his aggressiveness , ambition , and even his womanizing tendencies , but possessing them in far greater degree . During the episode , several of the characters express their admiration for the man even as they oppose him , with Kirk referring to him as \" the best of the tyrants , and the most dangerous . \" The character 's Spanish accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most Star Trek characters ."

This was a ceremony which took place every seven years where a group of townsfolk would inspect the channel and ensure that it was not being abused . The first recorded possessioning was in 1716 . In the mid nineteenth century the water courses were used for boiling vegetables , surface drainage and emptying cesspools .

Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet , leading to global warming or global cooling .

However , this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed , and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck ."

    "text": "A Providence watches over each man ’ s wandering through life . It provides him with two guides . The one calls him forward . The other calls him back . They are , however , not in opposition to each other , these two guides , nor do they leave the wanderer standing there in doubt , confused by the double call . Rather the two are in eternal understanding with each other . For the one beckons forward to the Good , the other calls man back from evil . … . The two guides call out to a man early and late , and when he listens to their call , then he finds his way , then he can know where he is , on the way . Because these two calls designate the place and show the way . Of these two , the call of remorse is perhaps the best . For the eager traveler who travels lightly along the way does not , in this fashion , learn to know it as well as a wayfarer with a heavy burden . The one who merely strives to get on does not learn to know the way as well as the remorseful man . The eager traveler hurries forward to the new , to the novel , and , indeed , away from experience . But the remorseful one , who comes behind , laboriously gathers up experience .

In June , Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo . On the Danube , the decisive Battle of Höchstädt , followed by success at Battle of Neuburg a few days later , allowed the French to take Munich and to control the Danube and its tributaries as far as Ingolstadt . With the French pressing on Austria from the north and through Italy , a truce ended hostilities for the rest of the summer . Despite these significant losses — both of them decisive — the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms . After the expiration of the summer truce in November 1800 , both the Austrian and French armies rushed to come to grips with each other in the terrain east of Munich . The newly appointed commander of Austrian forces , Archduke John , managed to bring the bulk of his army against Grenier 's left wing of Jean Moreau 's French army near Ampfing .

In 1980 , newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan 's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits . To finance these deficits , the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital . As foreign investors ' demand for U.S. dollars grew , the dollar 's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985 . The U.S. trade deficit grew to $ 160 billion in 1985 ( $ 341 billion in 2012 dollars ) as a result of the dollar 's strong appreciation . The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States ' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions , in what became known as the Plaza Accord . The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate , but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase . To address these concerns , the G7 ( now G8 ) held a summit in Paris in 1987 , where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies , in what became known as the Louvre Accord . This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies .

Philipp Melanchthon , the main delegate from Wittenberg , quickly prepared the draft that eventually became the Augsburg Confession . The Wittenberg theologians rejected attempts by Strasbourg to adopt it without the article on the Lord 's Supper . In response , Bucer wrote a new confession , the Confessio Tetrapolitana ( Tetrapolitan Confession ) , so named because only four cities adopted it , Strasbourg and three other southern German cities , Konstanz , Memmingen , and Lindau . A copy of Melanchthon 's draft was used as the starting point and the only major change was the wording on the article on the eucharist . According to Eells , the article on the eucharist in the Tetrapolitan Confession stated , \" In this sacrament his true body and true blood are truly given to eat and drink , as food for their souls , and to eternal life , that they may remain in him and he in them \" . The ambiguous word \" truly \" was not defined ."

Another category , connector routes , serve to connect two highways as their names suggest ; most of these connectors are unsigned .

The outcome of any given trial is much more strongly dependent on the state in which it took place , rather than whether it occurred before or after the CSI premiere . A 2010 study by the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee suggests that , while there may be a correlation between crime show viewership and a perceived understanding of DNA evidence , there was no evidence that such viewership affected jury decision making . As of August 2010 , no empirical evidence has demonstrated a correlation between CSI viewership and acquittal rates .

The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures , with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous , and plants in swales adapting to patchier , cooler fires with weaker serotiny . Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants , although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first . Eventually , however , the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped ; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected , allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other ."

There were fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first , especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries . In August 1939 , physicists Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner drafted the Einstein – Szilárd letter , which warned of the potential development of \" extremely powerful bombs of a new type \" . It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of uranium ore and accelerate the research of Enrico Fermi and others into nuclear chain reactions . They had it signed by Albert Einstein and delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt . Roosevelt called on Lyman Briggs of the National Bureau of Standards to head the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the issues raised by the letter . Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939 , which was attended by Szilárd , Wigner and Edward Teller . The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium \" would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known . \""

    "text": "However , as the number of sequences increases and especially in genome @-@ wide studies that involve many MSAs it is impossible to manually curate all alignments . Furthermore , manual curation is subjective . And finally , even the best expert cannot confidently align the more ambiguous cases of highly diverged sequences . In such cases it is common practice to use automatic procedures to exclude unreliably aligned regions from the MSA . For the purpose of phylogeny reconstruction ( see below ) the Gblocks program is widely used to remove alignment blocks suspect of low quality , according to various cutoffs on the number of gapped sequences in alignment columns . However , these criteria may excessively filter out regions with insertion / deletion events that may still be aligned reliably , and these regions might be desirable for other purposes such as detection of positive selection . A few alignment algorithms output site @-@ specific scores that allow the selection of high @-@ confidence regions . Such a service was first offered by the SOAP program , which tests the robustness of each column to perturbation in the parameters of the popular alignment program CLUSTALW . The T @-@ Coffee program uses a library of alignments in the construction of the final MSA , and its output MSA is colored according to confidence scores that reflect the agreement between different alignments in the library regarding each aligned residue . Its extension , TCS : ( Transitive Consistency Score ) , uses T @-@ Coffee libraries of pairwise alignments to evaluate any third party MSA . Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods , thus allowing a trade @-@ off between speed and accuracy . Another alignment program that can output an MSA with confidence scores is FSA , which uses a statistical model that allows calculation of the uncertainty in the alignment . The HoT ( Heads @-@ Or @-@ Tails ) score can be used as a measure of site @-@ specific alignment uncertainty due to the existence of multiple co @-@ optimal solutions . The GUIDANCE program calculates a similar site @-@ specific confidence measure based on the robustness of the alignment to uncertainty in the guide tree that is used in progressive alignment programs . An alternative , more statistically justified approach to assess alignment uncertainty is the use of probabilistic evolutionary models for joint estimation of phylogeny and alignment . A Bayesian approach allows calculation of posterior probabilities of estimated phylogeny and alignment , which is a measure of the confidence in these estimates . In this case , a posterior probability can be calculated for each site in the alignment . Such an approach was implemented in the program BAli @-@ Phy ."

Previously , the dominant approach was that of the literal rule , supplemented by the golden and mischief rules ( that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity , and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute ) . These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament . Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes , British courts began to use a more purposive approach , which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind it , rather than simply using the text of the statute itself . In effect , this widened the amount of material judges could use , including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies , the Law Commission and Royal Commissions .

It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation ; if mediastinitis ( inflammation of the tissues in the mid @-@ chest ) occurs ; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly ; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement . Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway , tears with loss of tissue , and a need for positive pressure ventilation . Damaged tissue around a rupture ( e.g. torn or scarred tissue ) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired . Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50 % . Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs ( the pericardium and pleura , respectively ) over the sutures to protect them . When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications , pneumonectomy or lobectomy ( removal of a lung or of one lobe , respectively ) may be required . Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure . Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma , as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed . When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis , surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis : the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired ."

Even if the user is able to use Senjutsu , they only have a certain amount of time before the natural energies are used up , as the user will still need to move around the battlefield and Senjutsu requires to user to remain still , although it can be bypassed by certain methods , such as summoning frog assistants or using shadow clones to help gather the energy .

Because of the difficulty in maintaining the natural energy , only a few people have been able to properly master Senjutsu ; Naruto Uzumaki is stated to be the first Senjutsu user under the tutelage of the Great Toad Sage , Gamamaru , who has achieved such feat .

However , scientists tentatively locate the origin of Raphanus sativus in southeast Asia , as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered . India , central China , and central Asia appear to have been secondary centers where differing forms were developed . Radishes enter the historical record in third century BC . Greek and Roman agriculturalists of the first century AD gave details of small , large , round , long , mild , and sharp varieties . The radish seems to have been one of the first European crops introduced to the Americas . A German botanist reported radishes of 100 lb ( 45 kg ) and roughly 3 ft in length in 1544 , although the only variety of that size today is the Japanese Sakurajima radish . The large , mild , and white East Asian form was developed in China , but is mostly associated in the West with the Japanese daikon , owing to Japanese agricultural development and larger exports ."

Proprietors , the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island , favoured a system of renting to tenants , whilst the tenants preferred a system of freehold . In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into lots to be owned by ' proprietors ' who would collect rent from the settlers , or ' tenants ' . Problems soon arose with this scheme , and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent , which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents . An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783 . In 1786 , Governor Walter Patterson , who set in motion the compulsory acquisition , was removed from office ."

The long @-@ term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia , depression , or anxiety syndromes , and progressively worsens over time .

The benefits of withdrawal include improved cognition , alertness , mobility , reduced risk incontinence , and a reduced risk of falls and fractures . The success of gradual @-@ tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people . Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses .

He expected that his main task would be to support the AIF ; but it turned out the primary concern was the looming war with Japan , which broke out soon after . It was at this juncture that Rowell was approached by Major General George Vasey , who had a scheme to retire all officers over the age of fifty , and making Major General Horace Robertson Commander in Chief . Presumably Vasey expected Rowell , as a fellow Duntroon graduate , to be sympathetic . A heated argument ensued , ending with Rowell telling Vasey that \" if he weren 't so bloody big , I 'd toss him out of the room \" .

Traveling between Vanuatu and New Caledonia , Beni reached its peak intensity as a Category 5 tropical cyclone on January 29 , the highest rating on the Australian cyclone scale , with winds of 235 km / h ( 146 mph ) . It only maintained this intensity for a short time before an increase in wind shear and less favorable conditions induced its weakening . After nearing Vanuatu , a strengthening ridge forced Beni towards the southwest , away from Vanuatu . The cyclone made its closest approach to the island of New Caledonia on January 30 , but only as a marginal Category 1 cyclone . Continuing to weaken under strong wind shear , Beni was downgraded to a tropical depression the same day .

The air is instead forced to spread out , giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape . The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus . The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles . As these fall , they melt to become rain . If the updraft is strong enough , the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large that they do not melt completely but fall as hail . While updrafts are still present , the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it , creating downdrafts as well . The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds .

Critics see The Tempest as explicitly concerned with its own nature as a play , frequently drawing links between Prospero 's \" art \" and theatrical illusion , and early critics saw Prospero as a representation of Shakespeare , and his renunciation of magic as signalling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage . The play portrays Prospero as a rational , and not an occultist , magician by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax : her magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible , where Prospero 's is said to be wondrous and beautiful . Beginning in about 1950 , with the publication of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni , The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens of postcolonial theory — exemplified in adaptations like Aimé Césaire 's Une Tempête set in Haiti — and there is even a scholarly journal on post @-@ colonial criticism named after Caliban ."

Jesper Asselman ( Team Roompot ) took over the lead after the second stage due to time bonuses , before losing it in the time trial to Jos van Emden ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) .

Wellens defended his lead on the final stage to win his second successive Eneco Tour ; he had been the defending champion after victory in 2014 .

    "text": "The amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown . The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale @-@ oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes . According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation , the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States ( comprising a mine , retorting plant , upgrading plant , supporting utilities , and spent shale reclamation ) , would range between US $ 70 – 95 ( $ 440 – 600 / m3 , adjusted to 2005 values ) . This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency . In order to run a profitable operation , the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels . The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex . The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35 – 70 % after producing its first 500 million barrels ( 79 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) . Assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day ( 4 @.@ 0 × 10 ^ 3 m3 / d ) during each year after the start of commercial production , RAND predicts the costs would decline to $ 35 – 48 per barrel ( $ 220 – 300 / m3 ) within 12 years . After achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels ( 160 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) , its costs would decline further to $ 30 – 40 per barrel ( $ 190 – 250 / m3 ) . Some commentators compare the proposed American oil @-@ shale industry to the Athabasca oil @-@ sands industry ( the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels ( 160 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil per day in late 2007 ) , stating that \" the first @-@ generation facility is the hardest , both technically and economically \" ."

Coming from Somerset , England , he was born and raised in the town of Ilchester , likely attending school in Limington , nearby . In 1635 , at the age of 19 , he accompanied his parents , siblings and other family members on a voyage from England to New England , where they first settled in Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . In less than a year they moved to Providence on the Narragansett Bay at the request of Roger Williams . In about 1638 they moved once again , about five miles south to the Pawtuxet River , settling on the north side at a place commonly called Pawtuxet . Here they had serious disputes with their neighbors , particularly Samuel Gorton , and as a result put themselves and their lands under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts , a situation lasting for 16 years ."

Following the devastating 1900 hurricane , donations by the newly created Red Cross , including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers , helped revive area communities . This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward . The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain . In fact , because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane , it was able to handle Galveston 's diverted shipping traffic until the island 's damaged port was repaired . Following another hurricane in 1915 , the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms , thus helping to build confidence in the safety of the port . One of the most immediate effects of the dike , however , was to increase the salt levels in West Bay , between Galveston and the southwest coastline ."

In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement , Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563 , similar to that passed in England one year earlier , which made witchcraft a capital crime . Despite the fact that Scotland probably had about one quarter of the population of England , it would have three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions , at about 6 @,@ 000 for the entire period . James VI 's visit to Denmark , a country familiar with witch hunts , may have encouraged an interest in the study of witchcraft .

Several people , most notably Agnes Sampson , were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James ' ship . James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and , inspired by his personal involvement , in 1597 wrote the Daemonologie , a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare 's Tragedy of Macbeth . James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches . After 1599 , his views became more sceptical ."

This was a job fraught with problems , as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid @-@ 1340s . The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of the early stages of the Hundred Years ' War . By then reneging on his debts , the king had lost public confidence , and struggled to obtain new loans . Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer . This did not entail controlling the king ’ s use of his resources — a move Edward would have resented greatly — but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses . By the early 1360s this was largely achieved ; a testimony to the capabilities and energy of Edington as an administrator . In 1356 he was named chancellor , a post he held until his retirement from the national scene in 1363 , possibly for health reasons ."

This can be formalized by considering an arbitrary sequence of push and pop operations on a stack , and forming a graph in which the stack operations correspond to the vertices of the graph , placed in sequence order along the spine of a book embedding . Then , if one draws an edge from each pop operation that pops an object x from the stack , to the previous push operation that pushed x , the resulting graph will automatically have a one @-@ page embedding . For this reason , the page number of a graph has also been called its stack number . In the same way , one may consider an arbitrary sequence of enqueue and dequeue operations of a queue data structure , and form a graph that has these operations as its vertices , placed in order on the spine of a single page , with an edge between each enqueue operation and the corresponding dequeue . Then , in this graph , each two edges will either cross or cover disjoint intervals on the spine . By analogy , researchers have defined a queue embedding of a graph to be an embedding in a topological book such that each vertex lies on the spine , each edge lies in a single page , and each two edges in the same page either cross or cover disjoint intervals on the spine . The minimum number of pages needed for a queue embedding of a graph is called its queue number ."

By the late 12th century , a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys , barons of Manchester . Ashton Old Hall was a manor house , the administrative centre of the manor , and the seat of the Assheton family . With three wings , the hall was \" one of the finest great houses in the North West \" of the 14th century . It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south @-@ east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country . The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414 , which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year , and a market on every Monday , making the settlement a market town ."

    "text": "Harrison used Campbell 's image filter theory , which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time . In this theory , filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem . More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs . Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being \" maximally flat \" . Norton 's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter . The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter , that is , one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance , whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends , making it hard to recognise the design for what it is . Another unusual feature of Norton 's filter design arises from the series capacitor , which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm . This is the only series capacitor in Norton 's representation , and without it , the filter could be analysed as a low @-@ pass prototype . Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit ( Norton 's figure 4 ) . Norton has used here the \" turning round the L \" impedance transform to achieve this ."

The family moved to Leicester Square , where George and his younger brother Prince Edward , Duke of York and Albany , were educated together by private tutors . Family letters show that he could read and write in both English and German , as well as comment on political events of the time , by the age of eight . He was the first British monarch to study science systematically . Apart from chemistry and physics , his lessons included astronomy , mathematics , French , Latin , history , music , geography , commerce , agriculture and constitutional law , along with sporting and social accomplishments such as dancing , fencing , and riding . His religious education was wholly Anglican . At age 10 George took part in a family production of Joseph Addison 's play Cato and said in the new prologue : \" What , tho ' a boy ! It may with truth be said , A boy in England born , in England bred \" . Historian Romney Sedgwick argued that these lines appear \" to be the source of the only historical phrase with which he is associated \" ."

The male typically deposits a spermatophore on the ground or in the water according to species , and the female picks this up with her vent . The spermatophore has a packet of sperm supported on a conical gelatinous base , and often an elaborate courtship behavior is involved in its deposition and collection . Once inside the cloaca , the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca , one or more chambers in the roof of the cloaca , where they are stored for sometimes lengthy periods until the eggs are laid . In the most primitive salamanders such as the Asiatic salamanders and the giant salamanders , external fertilization occurs , instead . In these species , the male releases sperm onto the egg mass in a reproductive process similar to that of typical frogs ."

However , in the winter of 1849 – 1850 , a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Willich and Karl Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising . Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising , the entire working class from across Europe would rise \" spontaneously \" to join it , thus , creating revolution across Europe . Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was \" adventuristic \" and would be suicide for the Communist League . Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper / Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe . This , Marx maintained , would spell doom for the Communist League itself . Changes in society , Marx argued , are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of \" a handful of men \" . Instead , they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development . In the present stage of development ( circa 1850 ) , following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 , Marx felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms , such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal ( male ) suffrage . In other words , the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution ."

    "text": "Although often a candidate in the press to captain England , Fender was never chosen to do so . Rumours circulated at the time about the reasons . One suggestion was that he was overlooked because he was Jewish , but Fender said he was not Jewish and in any case did not believe this would have been a problem . Other purported reasons included that he had not been to Oxford or Cambridge , and that he was in the wine trade , which was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman , but in later life Fender dismissed these as potential factors . In fact , not everyone approved of Fender 's captaincy . He was sometimes accused of gamesmanship , for example by persuading umpires that conditions were unfit for play until they favoured his team . He occasionally used negative tactics when he was unhappy with the approach of the opposition — in one game where the opposition had not declared , he slowed down play to the extent that one over took 12 minutes to bowl . Opponents recalled other uses of time @-@ wasting tactics , deliberate damaging of the pitch by Surrey players to assist their bowlers , and intimidation of both the opposition and umpires . The cricket writer Martin Williamson suggests that \" in an era where gentlemen played by the rules , Fender was adroit at stretching the Laws to snapping point . \" Fender 's attitude towards amateurs also brought him into opposition with others . His disinclination to play amateurs in the Surrey team unless they were talented enough was opposed by the Surrey committee — the Surrey president , H. D. G. Leveson Gower , wished Fender to include friends and contacts whom Fender did not consider worth a place in the team . According to E. W. Swanton : \" While always highly popular with the teams he led , his relations with the Surrey authorities were also apt to be difficult . \" Fender attempted to unite the amateurs and professionals in the team through using one gate to enter the field , and stopped the practice of separate lunches and teas . He planned to end the tradition of using separate changing rooms , until stopped by the professional Hobbs . Fender 's proposals shocked senior cricket figures , and caused another clash with the influential Lord Harris ; allied to other disagreements between the pair , it may have ended his England career . The deeply conservative cricket establishment may also have resented Fender 's unorthodoxy on the cricket pitch . Fender made himself more unacceptable by mocking establishment figures such as Leveson Gower ; a team @-@ mate later remarked that Fender \" was often his own worst enemy \" . Fender also believed that the controversy over his journalism in 1921 counted against him with the MCC committee . According to Wisden , Fender 's limited success at Test level \" may have saved the selectors , who were thought never to favour him as a captain of England , an embarrassing problem \" . His Wisden obituary concluded : \" He was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years ... and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation \" ."

The first trajectory is one of romanticism and escapist ideas , where bands cultivate an image of strength and barbarism and quote passages from various poems and sagas . The second trajectory emphasizes historical accuracy , typically relying on Norse mythology as the sole focus of lyricism and identity . Trafford and Pluskowski find that many Viking metal bands identify first with local roots — for instance , Moonsorrow with Finland or Einherjer with Norway — and perhaps a northern European identity second ."

For example , the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate @-@ determining step . Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium , its stable isotope . The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced , due to a primary kinetic isotope effect , which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen . It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions , such as 13C / 12C and 18O / 16O , but these effects are more subtle ."

Dewey came under pressure from his advisors to withdraw during the dinner break that followed the second ballot , and when the convention resumed to chants of \" We want Willkie ! \" from the packed galleries , Dewey continued to slip as the convention became a two @-@ horse race between Taft and Willkie . Listening by radio from his hotel room , Willkie refused to make a deal to get support from Taft delegates in exchange for making the Ohioan his running mate , and became convinced he would lose on the fifth ballot .

Bacon 's treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject 's physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender . More than any other of the artist 's close friends portrayed during this period , Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies . The paintings gave him stature , a raison d 'etre , and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer 's \" brief interlude between life and death \" . Many critics have cited Dyer 's portraits as favourites , including Michel Leiris and Lawrence Gowling . Yet as Dyer 's novelty diminished within Bacon 's circle of sophisticated intellectuals , the younger man became increasingly bitter and ill at ease . Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him , he did not pretend to understand or even like them . \" All that money an ' I fink they 're reely ' orrible \" , he observed with choked pride . He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism . Bacon 's money allowed Dyer to attract hangers @-@ on who would accompany him on massive benders around London 's Soho . Withdrawn and reserved when sober , Dyer was insuppressible when drunk , and would often attempt to \" pull a Bacon \" by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle . Dyer 's erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin — with his cronies , with Bacon , and with Bacon 's friends . Most of Bacon 's art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance — an intrusion into the world of high culture to which their Bacon belonged . Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent . By 1971 , he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover ."

Murdoch , his sons Walter and Alexander and Duncan , Earl of Lennox were in Stirling Castle for their trial on 18 May at a specially convened parliament . An assize of seven earls and fourteen lesser nobles were appointed to hear the evidence that linked the prisoners to the rebellion in the Lennox . The four men were condemned , Walter on 24 May and the others on 25 May and immediately beheaded in ' front of the castle ' . James demonstrated a ruthless and avaricious side to his nature in the destruction of his close family , the Albany Stewarts , that yielded the three forfeited earldoms of Fife , Menteith and Lennox . An enquiry set up by James in 1424 into the dispersal of crown estates since the reign of Robert I exposed legal defects in a number of transactions where the earldoms of Mar , March and Strathearn together with the Black Douglas lordships of Selkirk and Wigtown were found to be problematic . Strathearn and March were forfeited in 1427 and 1435 respectively . Mar was forfeited in 1435 on the earl 's death without heir which also meant that the lordships of Garioch and Badenoch reverted to the crown . James sought to boost his income further through taxation and succeeded in getting parliament to pass legislation in 1424 for a tax to go towards paying off the ransom — £ 26 @,@ 000 was raised but James sent only £ 12 @,@ 000 to England .

In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence ( quantum ) matter , yet not strong enough to require quantization itself , physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime . These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime , and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime . Using this formalism , it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation , leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time .

The goal made Maldini the oldest scorer in the history of the competition . Liverpool responded almost immediately ; John Arne Riise , who was picked out by a corner kick from Steven Gerrard , hit a volley from the edge of the penalty box . His shot was cleared only for Gerrard to cross in from the right wing , which Sami Hyypiä headed towards goal producing a save out of Dida . Milan almost extended their lead in the 13th minute , after Crespo 's header was cleared off the goal line by Luis García . A few minutes later , Liverpool made a substitution after Harry Kewell picked up a groin injury ; he was replaced by Vladimír Šmicer . Soon after , Kaká passed through to Andriy Shevchenko who put his shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek , but Shevchenko was adjudged to have been in an offside position and the goal did not stand . Shevchenko had another chance to score a few minutes later ; after being played onside by Traore , his shot was saved by Dudek after he came under pressure from the Liverpool defence . Luis García had two chances to score following Shevchenko 's shot ; the first shot from the edge of the penalty area went well over the crossbar and after he was headed through by Baroš his next shot went wide . Straight after this attack , Crespo went through on goal only to be flagged for offside . Almost immediately after this , Liverpool had a penalty claim turned down after Alessandro Nesta allegedly handballed . Milan countered and scored ; Kaka dribbled the ball into the Liverpool half and passed to Shevchenko , who passed to Crespo at the far post to score and make it 2 – 0 . Minutes later , Crespo extended Milan 's lead with a chip over Dudek after Kaka provided the assist to make it 3 – 0 ."

John Mullan , University College London 's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian , wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters ' thoughts , Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction . In the novel 's closing pages , Cal provides minute details about his father 's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother . Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male , his identity is not confined by his own body .

Appearing for the first time in the 1628 edition of the Anatomy is a section on planetary periods , which gives a period for Mars of three years – had Godwin used William Gilbert 's De Magnete ( 1600 ) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years .

Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris in the winter of 1907 – 08 , working with him four or five times each week . There is little documentation of Vaughan Williams 's time with Ravel ; the musicologist Byron Adams advises caution in relying on Vaughan Williams 's recollections in the Musical Autobiography written forty @-@ three years after the event . The degree to which the French composer influenced the Englishman 's style is debated . Ravel declared Vaughan Williams to be \" my only pupil who does not write my music \" ; nevertheless , commentators including Kennedy , Adams , Hugh Ottaway and Alain Frogley find Vaughan Williams 's instrumental textures lighter and sharper in the music written after his return from Paris , such as the String Quartet in G minor , On Wenlock Edge , the Overture to The Wasps and A Sea Symphony . Vaughan Williams himself said that Ravel had helped him escape from \" the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner \" ."

The press heard rumours about Lennon 's wife and child at the end of 1963 — after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe — and descended on her mother 's house in Hoylake ( where mother and son were staying ) , in November and December . Friends and neighbours protected their anonymity , but she was often approached by journalists . In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church , but didn 't tell Lennon ( who was on tour at the time ) , because she feared a media circus .

Not long after the christening , every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon 's secret wife and baby boy .

The league wanted to add other franchises in the Western United States , by then only represented through the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Francisco Warriors , and the owners liked Breitbard 's input during the meeting . Combining the city economic and population growths with the Gulls ' success , San Diego was chosen to receive an expansion team in 1967 . Breitbard paid an 1 @.@ 75 million dollars entry fee to join the NBA as an expansion team for the 1967 – 68 NBA season , along with the Seattle SuperSonics . The resulting contest to name the franchise chose the name \" Rockets \" , homaging San Diego 's theme of \" a city in motion \" and the local arm of General Dynamics developing the Atlas missile and booster rocket program . Breitbard brought in Jack McMahon , then coach of the Cincinnati Royals , to serve as the Rockets ' coach and general manager . The team then built its roster with both veteran players at an expansion draft , and college players in the 1967 NBA draft , where San Diego 's first ever draft pick was Pat Riley .

Infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from the heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating the space ( air ) it passes through . When infrared waves strike an object , they release their energy as heat . This heat is either absorbed or reflected by the cooler surface . Infrared energy is continually exchanged between \" hot \" and \" cold \" surfaces until all surfaces have reached the same temperature ( equilibrium ) . The colder the surfaces , the more effective the infrared transfer from the emitter .

When in 651 Penda attacked the monastery , Anna and his men arrived and held the Mercians back .

    "text": "Scholars have long noted Shakespeare 's widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play . Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as \" symbolic of the natural beauty of young love \" and later critics have expanded on this interpretation . For example , both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness . Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun , brighter than a torch , a jewel sparkling in the night , and a bright angel among dark clouds . Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb , he says her \" beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light . \" Juliet describes Romeo as \" day in night \" and \" Whiter than snow upon a raven 's back . \" This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols — contrasting love and hate , youth and age in a metaphoric way . Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony . For example , Romeo and Juliet 's love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them , but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness , while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight . This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers : loyalty to family or loyalty to love . At the end of the story , when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow , light and dark have returned to their proper places , the outward darkness reflecting the true , inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers . All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events , and things return to the natural order , thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet . The \" light \" theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time , since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun , moon , and stars ."

Johnston instructed Beauregard to stay in the rear and direct men and supplies as needed , while he rode to the front to lead the men on the battle line . This effectively ceded control of the battle to Beauregard , who had a different concept , which was simply to attack in three waves and push the Union army eastward to the river . The corps of Hardee and Bragg began the assault with their divisions in one line , nearly 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) wide and about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from its front to its rear column .

In 2012 , total global production of fish , crustaceans , molluscs , and other aquatic animals was a record 158 million metric tons ( 174 million tons ) , of which 91 @.@ 3 million metric tons ( 100 million tons ) were caught in the wild . This is also a record if ignoring the Peruvian anchovy , whose population can vary dramatically with the El Niño cycle . The overall trend remains increasing , but due to expanding aquaculture in inland waters and mariculture in the sea rather than higher catches in the wild . The exclusive economic zones around coastal countries under the UNCLOS regime have permitted states to institute quota and other management systems over the most productive regions of the sea , accounting for around 87 % of the annual harvest . The results are sometimes dramatic — the lull in fishing over the course of the First World War saw the North Sea 's 1919 catch double 1913 's — and sometimes much less so : two decades on , the levels of cod in the Grand Banks remain only 10 % of their peak . At present , the species most frequently landed are herring , cod , anchovy , tuna , flounder , mullet , squid , and salmon . A number of these , as well as large predatory fish , remain well below historical levels ."

At the time of the upgrade , the system was situated about 320 mi ( 515 km ) south of Kingston , Jamaica The environment around the newly formed depression was characterized by an area of weak steering currents south of a ridge extending eastward from the Gulf of Mexico . Low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures were conducive for strengthening , and perhaps rapid deepening . Late on October 22 , a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) in a rainband well removed from the center of circulation , prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Sandy .

The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues , for example , the application of rules of natural justice . As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation , it is crucial that the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty , unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm ."

    "text": "These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark . Other local factors , such as altitude and climate , can also significantly affect play . A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher 's park or a hitter 's park , if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements . The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field , home of the Colorado Rockies . Its high altitude — 5 @,@ 282 feet ( 1 @,@ 610 m ) above sea level — is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter 's park effect in the major leagues . Wrigley Field , home of the Chicago Cubs , is known for its fickle disposition : a hitter 's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out , it becomes more of a pitcher 's park when they are blowing in . The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out , but the nature of team rosters and players ' statistical records . For example , hitting a fly ball 330 feet ( 100 m ) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park , and a home run at another . A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field , such as the New York Yankees , will tend to stock its roster with left @-@ handed pull hitters , who can best exploit it . On the individual level , a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter 's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time — even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park ."

The scene represents class and status differences , and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy .

In all cases , rhyming is obligatory . The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style , and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular . For the other variations of shi poetry , generally either a four line ( quatrain , or jueju ) or else an eight line poem is normal ; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming . The line length is scanned by according number of characters ( according to the convention that one character equals one syllable ) , and are predominantly either five or seven characters long , with a caesura before the final three syllables . The lines are generally end @-@ stopped , considered as a series of couplets , and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device . The \" old style \" verse ( gushi ) is less formally strict than the jintishi , or regulated verse , which , despite the name \" new style \" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back to Shen Yue , in the 5th or 6th century , although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of Chen Zi 'ang ( 661 – 702 ) A good example of a poet known for his gushi poems is Li Bai . Among its other rules , the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem , including the use of set patterns of the four tones of Middle Chinese The basic form of jintishi ( lushi ) has eight lines in four couplets , with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets . The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words .

Put simply , using observed mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution do not reproduce the observed distribution of evolved massive stars such as Wolf – Rayets , the number and types of core collapse supernovae , or their progenitors . To match those observations , the models require much higher mass loss rates . Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates , currently around 10 − 3 M ☉ / year , and is an obvious candidate for study ."

The sequence was published in 1998 , although some small gaps were present ; the last gap was finished by October 2002 . The C. elegans genome is about 100 million base pairs long and consists of six chromosomes and a mitochondrial genome . Its gene density is about one gene per five kilo @-@ base pairs . Introns make up 26 % and intergenic regions 47 % of the genome . Many genes are arranged in clusters and how many of these are operons is unclear .

It stores the unstructured components as files while storing the structured metadata in the structured store . Internally , WinFS uses a relational database to manage data .

The WinFS runtime maps the schema to a relational modality , by defining the tables it will store the types in and the primary keys and foreign keys that would be required to represent the relationships . WinFS includes mappings for object and XML schemas by default . Mappings for other schemas must be specified . Object schemas are specified in XML ; WinFS generates code to surface the schemas as .NET classes . ADO.NET can be used to directly specify the relational schema , though a mapping to the object schema must be provided to surface it as classes . Relationship traversals are performed as joins on these tables . WinFS also automatically creates indexes on these tables , to enable fast access to the information . Indexing speeds up joins significantly , and traversing relationships to retrieve related data is performed very fast . Indexes are also used during information search ; searching and querying use the indexes to quickly complete the operations , much like desktop search systems ."

In minor actions and skirmishes , nine officers and 265 men were killed and four officers and 123 men were wounded , but not fatally . Sixty @-@ two officers and 2 @,@ 802 men were taken prisoner , and 137 men were missing . Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted .

Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons , the most stable of which are protons and neutrons , the components of atomic nuclei . Due to a phenomenon known as color confinement , quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation ; they can be found only within hadrons , such as baryons ( of which protons and neutrons are examples ) , and mesons . For this reason , much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves ."

The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union , but they were convinced by a number of key commanders , including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov , to assume a defensive posture instead . This would allow the Germans to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions , after which the Soviet forces would be able to reposture and go on the offensive . A similar strategy discussion occurred on the German side , with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviets to advance , while the Germans launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition . But for political reasons Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive , choosing the Kursk salient for the attack .

The march proved difficult , due to both the harsh terrain and the open hostility of the local population — the Western sources ( the Annales Ceccanenses , Richard of San Germano , Philippe Mouskes , and the continuator of Robert of Auxerre ) also stress the loyalty of the local Albanian population to Theodore . After a few days , Theodore with his army confronted Peter . Theodore requested talks with the papal legate , Giovanni Colonna , whom he assured of his goodwill and support . Western sources claim that Theodore offered to recognize the primacy of the Catholic Church and the suzerainty of the Latin Empire — as well as to support Peter in his planned participation in the Fifth Crusade — and offered the Latins food and guides through the mountains . Peter was glad to receive this unexpected help , and an agreement between the two was concluded . As soon as the Latins let their guard down , Theodore fell upon them . Peter of Courtenay , Colonna , the Latin Archbishop of Salona , Count William I of Sancerre , and many Latin nobles were taken captive , while Peter 's army scattered into small roving bands trying to survive .

Struck at the West Point Bullion Depository , the medallions contained 90 % gold , and were issued in two sizes : one containing one troy ounce ( 31 g ) of gold and one containing one half @-@ ounce ( 16 g ) of the metal . The first struck were those honoring Grant Wood on the one ounce medallion and Marian Anderson on the half @-@ ounce piece . Both were designed by United States Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro . Sales were poor , and in September 1980 , the Mint announced that a private firm , commodity traders J. Aron and Company , would market the medallions . The new plan involved selling the medallions through a network of bullion dealers , banks , brokerage houses and coin dealers , a system similar to that South Africa used to distribute the Krugerrand in the US . In 1981 , the second year of production , the composition of the medallions was changed ; although the 90 % gold purity was retained , the balance was altered to include silver , which was added to change their appearance . That year 's medallions depicted Mark Twain and Willa Cather . These were designed by Matthew Poloso and Sherl Winter , respectively . These first four medallions bore no notation of their metallic content or country of origin . This was done to distinguish them from federal coinage . Beginning in 1982 , this information and small , toothlike designs , known as \" denticles \" , were added along the inner rim of the medallions , and reeding was added to the edge . That year 's issues depicted Louis Armstrong , as designed by John Mercanti , and Frank Lloyd Wright , designed by Edgar Steever . The following year 's medallions depicted Robert Frost and Alexander Calder . The former was designed by P. Fowler , while the latter was by Michael Iacocca . The final year of production saw the mintage of medallions with designs by John Mercanti honoring Helen Hayes and John Steinbeck . The Mint terminated the contract with J. Aron and Company in 1984 , opting instead to sell the medallions through a telemarketing program . In 1985 , Mint director Donna Pope announced that the medallions would be sold in another telemarketing operation in sets of five of either one each of the one ounce medallions or one each of the half @-@ ounce pieces , beginning in September of that year and ending on December 31 , or sooner if all sets sold ."

In 1711 , Yesayi , accompanying Israel Ori , traveled to Russia to help build support for an army under Peter the Great . Ori , however , died on the way , and Yesayi soon took over as the lead figure of the movement . He continued negotiations with Peter , and in a letter sent to him in 1718 , promised the support of a 10 @-@ 12 @,@ 000 @-@ man Armenian army as well as support from neighboring Georgian forces .

In 1795 , the Treaty of Greenville was signed and a small part of eastern Indiana was opened for settlement . Fort Miami at Kekionga was occupied by the United States , who rebuilt it as Fort Wayne . After the treaty , the powerful Miami nation considered themselves allies with the United States . The war ended hostilities with the Native Americans , leaving them victorious in 31 of the 37 recorded incidents involving white settlers during the 18th century ."

Animator Randal M.

Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging , considering \" Steven wanted to make sure that these creatures were 150 feet tall \" , as it was the height described by Wells in the novel .

Having marched to East Anglia to capture Princess Mary , he surrendered on hearing that the Privy Council had changed sides and proclaimed Mary as Queen . Convicted of high treason , Northumberland returned to Catholicism and abjured the Protestant faith before his execution . Having secured the contempt of both religious camps , popularly hated , and a natural scapegoat , he became the \" wicked Duke \" — in contrast to his predecessor Somerset , the \" good Duke \" .

In most filter designs , this can be difficult to do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly . Trimming is done in at least two stages ; coarse and fine , with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the specified value . Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency . The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the tolerances of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for ."

In it he proclaims the depredations of the \" Danes \" ( who were , at that point , primarily Norwegian invaders ) a scourge from God to lash the English for their sins . He calls upon them to repent of their sinful ways and \" return to the faith of baptism , where there is protection from the fires of hell . \" He also wrote many homilies relating to the Last Days and the coming of the Antichrist . Age of the Antichrist was a popular theme in Wulfstan 's homilies , which also include the issues of death and Judgment Day . Six homilies that illustrate this theme include : Secundum Matheum , Secundum Lucam , De Anticristo , De Temporibus Antichrist , Secundum Marcum and \" De Falsis Deis \" . De Antichristo was the \" first full development of the Antichrist theme \" , and Wulfstan addressed it to the clergy . Believing that he lived at the time right before the Antichrist was to come , he felt compelled to diligently warn and teach the clergy to withstand the dishonest teaching of the enemies of God . These six homilies also include : emphasis that the hour of the Antichrist is very near , warnings that the English should be aware of false Christs who will attempt to seduce men , warnings that God will pass judgement on man 's faithfulness , discussion of man 's sins , evils of the world , and encouragement to love God and do his will . He wrote the Canons of Edgar and The Law of Edward and Guthrum which date before 1008 . The Canons was written to instruct the secular clergy serving a parish in the responsibilities of their position . The Law of Edward and Guthrum , on the other hand , is an ecclesiastical law handbook . Modern editors have paid most attention to his homilies : they have been edited by Arthur Napier , by Dorothy Whitelock , and by Dorothy Bethurum . Since that publication , other works that were likely authored by Wulfstan have been identified ; a forthcoming edition by Andy Orchard will update the canon of Wulfstan 's homilies . Wulfstan was also a book collector ; he is responsible for amassing a large collection of texts pertaining to canon law , the liturgy , and episcopal functions . This collection is known as Wulftan 's Commonplace Book . A significant part of the Commonplace book consists of a work once known as the Excerptiones pseudo @-@ Ecgberhti , though it has most recently been edited as Wulfstan 's Canon Law Collection ( a.k.a. Collectio canonum Wigorniensis ) . This work is a collection of conciliar decrees and church canons , most of which he culled from numerous ninth and tenth @-@ century Carolingian works . This work demonstrates the wide range of Wulfstan 's reading and studies . He sometimes borrowed from this collection when he wrote his later works , especially the law codes of Æthelred . There are also a number of works which are associated with the archbishop , but whose authorship is unknown , such as the Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor ."

    "text": "The emotional character of the ceremonies around the memorials changed as grieving took place and many individuals , inevitably , continued with their lives . Some early ceremonies around memorials were believed to be closely associated with spiritual events . The opening of the Menin Gate memorial , for example , inspired Will Longstaff 's dream that led to the famous Menin Gate at Midnight painting , portraying the fallen dead rising and walking through the gateway , while the Cenotaph ceremonies were photographed in 1922 , and believed by some to show the ghosts of the war dead . Indeed , early ceremonies at the London Cenotaph after the war were felt to be particularly emotional ; commentators felt that by the late 1920s , the events were more formal and less fraught with emotional than previously . Initially foreign diplomats in Britain were expected to lay wreaths on Armistice Day ; this requirement was reviewed in the 1930s . In Australia , there were initially many local ceremonies at memorials on Anzac Day specifically for bereaved mothers ; by the 1930s , these had been discontinued and incorporated into the wider ceremonial occasion ."

Seldes expanded this article as part of his book on the popular arts , The Seven Lively Arts ( 1924 ) , in which Seldes argued against conservative tendencies that excluded artists in the popular arts , such as Herriman and Chaplin , from being considered alongside traditional artists .

Furthermore , Evans significantly raised the license fees for his use of his patented technology , raising claims of extortion from those being asked to pay , and a great many cases ended up in court . The 1808 act had indemnified those who had adopted Evans 's technologies from 1805 to 1808 , but did not specify whether this indemnity was perpetual ( as defendants argued ) or whether it was only for the three years in question ( as Evans argued ) . Evans by this stage of his life had also established a poor reputation for himself amongst the milling community , and his abrasive and often petty pursuit of patent rights stiffened resistance . Several major legal cases questioned whether laws to extend private patents in this manner were even constitutional , but Evans ultimately prevailed in each case ."

The CJ & M had built south from Michigan to Carlisle , Ohio in 1887 , and initially acquired trackage rights over the CH & D to reach Cincinnati .

Loud calls from males indicate the group is ready to move to another tree to feed . This monkey is mainly a foliovore , and on average , half of the leaves consumed are young leaves . They also eat leaf shoots , seeds , flowers , and unripe fruit . It has also been found eating bark , dead wood , and soil . It is one of the few species that do not eat ripe fruits ; it has a sacculated stomach with four chambers specific for breaking down plant materials , however it cannot digest the sugars contained in mature fruits . Because the monkey feeds on young leaves ( though not limited to them ) , there are instances where it consumes charcoal , which is believed to aid their digestion of the toxins ( possibly phenolic compounds ) found in the young leaves of the Indian almond tree and mango tree . The habit of consuming charcoal is thought to be a learned behavior presumably passed on from the mother to her offspring . It has been noted , however , that not all populations on the islands carry out the behavior , but that it is rather mostly done by those who consume more perennial and exotic foliage ."

The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion , which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms . This physical world is hence seen as \" a domain for learning and growth \" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence .

Sommers had been inspired to explore the G.I. Joe universe after visiting Hasbro 's headquarters in Rhode Island . The project had found the momentum based on the success of Transformers , which Bonaventura produced with Murphy . Sommers partly signed on to direct because the concept reminded him of James Bond , and he described an underwater battle in the story as a tribute to Thunderball . Stuart Beattie was hired to write a new script for Sommers 's film , and G.I. Joe comic and filecard writer Larry Hama was hired as creative consultant . Hama helped them change story elements that fans would have disliked and made it closer to the comics , ultimately deciding fans would enjoy the script . He persuaded them to drop a comic scene at the film 's end , where Snake Eyes speaks . To speed up production before the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike , John Lee Hancock , Brian Koppelman and David Levien also assisted in writing various scenes .

    "text": "Foot binding is the process in which the arch of a woman 's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch . These \" fists of flesh \" were seen as attractive and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations . Special shoes were made to accentuate the small size of the women 's feet . This process was painful and often confined women to their rooms . Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed to be able to walk normally to accomplish house work . Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women . Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary for their own sake . The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese “ women ” . Naturally , the foot binding was recognized as “ national shame , ” and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared , thus raging anti @-@ footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s . Moreover , the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice . Thus , it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920 . However , the practice was still popular within the interior areas of China till the 1930s and even in the 1950s . The practice has been outlawed multiple times since its inception in the 13th century . It was finally banned as the Communists came to power around 1949 ."

The English chemist Charles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 and named it columbium . In 1809 , the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical . The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium . In 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably . Niobium was officially adopted as the name of the element in 1949 , but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States ."

Clan members who wear their chief 's crest and motto surrounded by a strap and buckle , show they are a member of the chief 's clan ( family ) . There are established clans that do not have chiefs recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms . In such cases clan members sometimes wear the crest badge of the last known chief . Some clans wear crest badges derived from the arms of individuals who were never recognised as clan chiefs .

In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment . Several new aspects of the site were discovered . In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island Hoy , about 10 miles away . Secondly , it consists of two straight lengths , angled at a few degrees to each other . Thirdly , the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy . Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill , just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right . This indicated line points to sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year ( according to A.

Fourthly a similar ' double sunset ' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags , also on Hoy ; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice , at the beginning of November and February respectively – the Old Celtic festivals of Samhain and Imbolc .

When the young tortoises emerge from their shells , they must dig their way to the surface , which can take several weeks , though their yolk sac can sustain them up to seven months . In particularly dry conditions , the hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil , while flooding of the nest area can drown them . Subspecies are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces . The young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10 – 15 years , encountering hazards such as falling into cracks , being crushed by falling rocks , or excessive heat stress . The Galápagos hawk was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings ; Darwin wrote : \" The young tortoises , as soon as they are hatched , fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard \" . The hawk is now much rarer , but introduced feral pigs , dogs , cats , and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises . The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans ; Darwin noted : \" The old ones seem generally to die from accidents , as from falling down precipices . At least several of the inhabitants told me , they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause \" ."

The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations ( see Kozai mechanism ) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region ( inside 4 AU in the Solar System ) . If giant planets form too early , they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion . If they form near the end of the oligarchic stage , as is thought to have happened in the Solar System , they will influence the merges of planetary embryos , making them more violent . As a result , the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive . In addition , the size of the system will shrink , because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star . The influence of giant planets in the Solar System , particularly that of Jupiter , is thought to have been limited because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets ."

Nevertheless , in the memoirs of contemporaries such as Lord Hervey and Horace Walpole , George is depicted as a weak buffoon , governed by his wife and ministers . Biographies of George written during the nineteenth and first part of the twentieth century relied on these biased accounts .

Letters from ministers are annotated by George with pertinent remarks and demonstrate that he had a grasp of and interest in foreign policy in particular . He was often able to prevent the appointment of ministers or commanders he disliked , or sideline them into lesser offices . This academic reassessment of George II , however , has not totally eliminated the popular perception of him as a \" faintly ludicrous king \" . His parsimony , for example , may have opened him to ridicule , but his biographers observe that parsimony is preferable to extravagance . Lord Charlemont excused George 's short temper by explaining that sincerity of feeling is better than deception , \" His temper was warm and impetuous , but he was good @-@ natured and sincere .

The origin myth of the Scots , systematised by John of Fordun ( c . 1320 @-@ c . 1384 ) , traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota , allowing them to argue superiority over the English , who claimed their descent from the Trojans , who had been defeated by the Greeks .

The stated aim of the pilot was to evaluate the contributions to economic growth and sustainable development by Combined Authorities . The Local Democracy , Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 enabled the creation of a Combined Authority for Greater Manchester with devolved powers on public transport , skills , housing , regeneration , waste management , carbon neutrality and planning permission , pending approval from the ten councils . Such strategic matters would be decided on via an enhanced majority rule voting system involving ten members appointed from among the councillors of the metropolitan boroughs ( one representing each borough with each council nominating one substitute ) without the input of central government . The ten district councils of Greater Manchester approved the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority ( GMCA ) on 29 March 2010 , and submitted final recommendations for a constitution to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport . On 31 March 2010 the Communities Secretary John Denham approved the constitution and launched a 15 @-@ week public consultation on the draft bill together with the approved constitution . Following requests by the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities , which was superseded by the GMCA , the new authority came into being on 1 April 2011 . On the same day , the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee was also formed from a pool of 33 councillors allocated by council population ( roughly one councillor per 75 @,@ 000 residents ) to scrutinise the running of Greater Manchester 's transport bodies and their finances , approve the decisions and policies of said bodies and form strategic policy recommendations or projects for the approval of the Combined Authority . On 3 November 2014 , George Osborne , the Chancellor of the Exchequer , announced that there would be an eleventh member of the GMCA — a directly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester , with \" powers over transport , housing , planning and policing \" from 2017 . This announcement was followed up on 25 February 2015 with news that Greater Manchester would be the first part of England to \" get full control of its health spending \" with a devolution deal from April 2016 ."

Unlike neurofibromatosis , Proteus syndrome affects tissue other than nerves , and it is a sporadic disorder rather than a genetically transmitted disease . Cohen and Tibbles said that Merrick showed the following signs of Proteus syndrome : \" macrocephaly ; hyperostosis of the large skull ; hypertrophy of long bones ; and thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues , particularly of the hands and feet , including plantar hyperplasia , lipomas , and other unspecified subcutaneous masses . \""
