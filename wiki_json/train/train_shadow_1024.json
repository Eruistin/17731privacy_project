Additionally , RIDOT laid the highway out so that Route 4 would cross through wetlands in the area . This sparked environmental concerns , as one of the large wetlands that would be affected , Froberg 's Marsh , was deemed to be of high value by Rhode Island environmentalists . Despite local and environmental concerns , RIDOT still considers the Route 4 upgrade to be the safest way to improve traffic flow in the region . While the Department of Transportation considered upgrading nearby Route 2 to freeway standards as a potential alternative , this plan was ultimately rejected because of its effects on wells in the area .

He had received a congratulatory letter from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose : \" about the best of any of the Candidates in the group \" . Despite this warmth , Waugh 's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable — \" not at all the kind of don for whom I had been prepared by stories of Jowett . \" The first recorded clash between them came early in Waugh 's first term ; in a letter to his school friend Dudley Carew , Waugh reports that his tutor verbally abused him for a Latin mistranslation with the words \" Damn you , you 're a scholar ! \" The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed was Waugh 's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship . Whereas Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study , Waugh considered it a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure . To the detriment of his work , Waugh involved himself in a range of university activities : the Oxford Union , the Hertford debating society , journalism and drawings for the undergraduate papers Isis and Cherwell , and a hectic social life . In his third term , he was brusquely advised by Cruttwell that he should take his studies more seriously , a warning which Waugh chose to interpret as an insult . \" I think it was from then on that our mutual dislike became incurable \" , he later wrote ."

Only a handful of earldoms had existed under Henry I and these had been largely symbolic in nature . Stephen created many more , filling them with men he considered to be loyal , capable military commanders , and in the more vulnerable parts of the country assigning them new lands and additional executive powers . Stephen appears to have had several objectives in mind , including both ensuring the loyalty of his key supporters by granting them these honours , and improving his defences in key parts of the kingdom . Stephen was heavily influenced by his principal advisor , Waleran de Beaumont , the twin brother of Robert of Leicester . The Beaumont twins and their younger brother and cousins received the majority of these new earldoms . From 1138 onwards , Stephen gave them the earldoms of Worcester , Leicester , Hereford , Warwick and Pembroke , which — especially when combined with the possessions of Stephen 's new ally , Prince Henry , in Cumberland and Northumbria — created a wide block of territory to act as a buffer zone between the troubled south @-@ west , Chester , and the rest of the kingdom .

The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards . In 1976 , he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again . During the filming from February to June 1976 , the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated .

He was certifiable . \" With declining physical health , Sellers could at times be unbearable on set . His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish , and he frequently threw tantrums , often threatening to abandon projects . Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a \" volatile and perplexing character [ who ] left a trail of misery in his private life \" . He also noted that Sellers had a \" compulsive personality and [ was ] an eccentric hypochondriac \" who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period . His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work . Despite Sellers 's deep personal problems , The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically . Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film , \" There is , too , something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers ' Clouseau , a fellow who , when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion , gets tangled up in his necktie , and who , when he masquerades — for reasons never gone into — as Quasimodo , overinflates his hump with helium . \" Sellers 's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards ."

Franco 's variation of the film concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon , Dr. Orloff , to reconstruct the face of his disfigured daughter Melissa . Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates Orlof using his girlfriend , Wanda Bronsky , as an undercover spy . Franco followed with several sequels to Gritos en la noche . He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film , Faceless ( 1988 ) . Faceless has a similar plot involving beautiful women who are abducted by Dr. Flamand 's ( Helmut Berger ) female assistant and kept hostage . The doctor uses the skin of the women to perform plastic surgery on his disfigured sister , but the experiments leave the victims mutilated and dead . The Italian film Atom Age Vampire ( 1961 ) was also influenced by Eyes Without a Face with a doctor attempting to take the faces of other women to repair his daughter 's face . These homages are seen in the plot line of a police lieutenant who is investigating the circumstances behind the death of a young girl whose body has scars around the eyes . The lieutenant 's investigation eventually leads him to a plastic surgery clinic , a similar plot motivation to Eyes Without a Face .

Osmólska and Roniewicz initially concluded that Deinocheirus did not belong in any already named theropod family , so they created a new , monotypic family Deinocheiridae , placed in the infraorder Carnosauria . This was due to the large size and thick @-@ walled limb bones , but they also found some similarities with Ornithomimus , and , to a lesser extent , Allosaurus . In 1971 , John Ostrom first proposed that Deinocheirus belonged with the Ornithomimosauria , while noting that it contained both ornithomimosaurian and non @-@ ornithomimosaurian characters . In 1976 , Rhinchen Barsbold named the order Deinocheirosauria , which was to include the supposedly related genera Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus . A relationship between Deinocheirus and the long @-@ armed therizinosaurs was supported by some later writers , but they are not considered to be closely related today ."

The bishops were asked to approve the Constitutions of Clarendon , which proposed restrictions on the powers of the Church and limits to papal authority in England ; Becket 's refusal led to the great dispute between king and archbishop , into which Foliot and his fellow bishops were inevitably drawn . When Becket appeared before the court with his archiepiscopal cross borne before him , a studied insult to the king , Foliot told the archbishop that \" If the king were to brandish his sword , as you now brandish yours , what hope can there be of peace between you ? \" The king refused to see Becket , and negotiations between the two camps soon revealed that Becket had ordered the bishops to refuse to pass judgement on him and threatened them with suspension from ecclesiastical office if they did . Becket also threatened to appeal the case to the papacy . Both of these actions by the archbishop breached the Constitutions of Clarendon . During the subsequent back and forth between the bishops and the king , as well as the bishops and the archbishop , Foliot was asked by one of his fellow bishops to try and persuade Becket to modify his behaviour .

The new college faces many new challenges , such as working with limited space and funding . Nevertheless , MSU 's music college plans on continued success , placing an annual average of 25 graduate students in tenure stream university positions ."

    "text": "At the start of 339 BC , the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae , which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC . Philip does not appear to have treated this as a declaration of war , but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem , blocking the main route into Greece . However , a second route into central Greece was available , leading over the shoulder of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis . However , the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road , or believed that Philip would not use it ; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered . Philip 's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit . Reaching Elatea , he ordered the city to be re @-@ populated , and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state . This provided Philip with a base in Greece , and new , grateful allies in the Phocians . Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC , but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC . During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa . He tricked a force of 10 @,@ 000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts , then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens , turning it over to Delphi . He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to avoid further conflict in Greece , although if so , he was unsuccessful ."

The stomach is divided into two parts : a muscular gizzard that grinds food , and a digestive chamber where enzymes work on it . The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths , which play a role in the mechanical breakdown of food . Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures . Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and consequently , low energy requirements . This allows them to survive for many months on a single large meal , digesting the food slowly . They can withstand extended fasting , living on stored fat between meals . Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food , losing 23 % of their bodyweight during this time . An adult crocodile needs between a tenth and a fifth of the amount of food necessary for a lion of the same weight , and can live for half a year without eating ."

The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies ' reactions to the effects of the player 's actions , such as turning off the lights , as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly . Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects , staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction . Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small , fixed distance . Overall , stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to , with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions . Often , the AI 's movements are predictable and regular , allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries . Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games , either by restricting the player to ineffective or non @-@ lethal weapons , equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers , or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous . Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre , in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player .

The r @-@ process happens in mediums of great electron density .

    "text": "The animals are vulnerable to bushfires due to their slow movements and the flammability of eucalypt trees . The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches , where it is vulnerable to intense heat and flames . Bushfires also fragment the animal 's habitat , which restricts their movement and leads to population decline and loss of genetic diversity . Dehydration and overheating can also prove fatal . Consequently , the koala is vulnerable to the effects of climate change . Models of climate change in Australia predict warmer and drier climates , suggesting that the koala 's range will shrink in the east and south to more mesic habitats . Droughts also affect the koala 's well @-@ being . For example , a severe drought in 1980 caused many Eucalyptus trees to lose their leaves . Subsequently , 63 % of the population in southwestern Queensland died , especially young animals that were excluded from prime feeding sites by older , dominant koalas , and recovery of the population was slow . Later , this population declined from an estimated mean population of 59 @,@ 000 in 1995 to 11 @,@ 600 in 2009 , a reduction attributed largely to hotter and drier conditions resulting from droughts in most years between 2002 and 2007 .

Jesus tells his followers to adhere to Jewish law , although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself , for example regarding the Sabbath . When asked what the greatest commandment is , Jesus replies : \" You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind ... And a second is like it : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself \" ( Matthew 22 : 37 – 39 ) . Other ethical teachings of Jesus include loving one 's enemies , refraining from hatred and lust , and turning the other cheek ( Matthew 5 : 21 – 44 ) . In the Gospel of John , when an adulteress is about to be stoned to death in accordance with Moses ' Law , the Pharisees ask Jesus what he will say in this situation , to which Jesus replied \" Let anyone among you who has no sin be the first to throw a stone at her \" , causing the accusers to go away , and Jesus says to the woman that he does not condemn her for no one has , and tells her to not sin again ( John 8 : 1 @-@ 11 ) ."

    "text": "Liszt found his method through two compositional practices , which he used in his symphonic poems .

Liszt took Beethoven 's practice one step further , combining separate movements into a single @-@ movement cyclic structure . Many of Liszt 's mature works follow this pattern , of which Les préludes is one of the best @-@ known examples . The second practice was thematic transformation , a type of variation in which one theme is changed , not into a related or subsidiary theme but into something new , separate and independent . Thematic transformation , like cyclic form , was nothing new in itself ; it had already been used by Mozart and Haydn . In the final movement of his Ninth Symphony , Beethoven had transformed the theme of the \" Ode to Joy \" into a Turkish march . Weber and Berlioz had also transformed themes , and Schubert used thematic transformation to bind together the movements of his Wanderer Fantasy , a work that had a tremendous influence on Liszt . However , Liszt perfected the creation of significantly longer formal structures solely through thematic transformation , not only in the symphonic poems but in other works such as his Second Piano Concerto and his Piano Sonata in B minor . In fact , when a work had to be shortened , Liszt tended to cut sections of conventional musical development and preserve sections of thematic transformation ."

Cope found educating his students at Haverford \" a pleasure \" , but wrote to his father that he \" could not get any work done . \" He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield , in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey . Due to the time @-@ consuming nature of his Haverford position , Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it out to others , but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits .

Alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming , and Edward focused on his scientific career . He continued his continental travels , including trips to Virginia , Tennessee , and North Carolina . He visited caves across the region . He stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana , but remained interested in the subject . Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the 1860s , paying periodic visits to the marl pits . The fossils he found in these pits became the focus of several papers , including a description in 1868 of Elasmosaurus platyurus and Laelaps . Marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions . Cope 's proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more frequent trips possible . The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard .

The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats through the process of bioturbation . By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients , mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production . Once burrowing to the bottom of the lake , mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills .

In August 2015 , in an interview with Rolling Stone , Dre lamented his abusive past , saying , \" I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life . I was young , fucking stupid . I would say all the allegations aren 't true — some of them are . Those are some of the things that I would like to take back . It was really fucked up .

There was a tradition of even smaller books , whose use seems to have been often amuletic , and a manuscript of John alone , with a page size of 72 x 56 mm , was found in a reliquary at Chartres Cathedral in 1712 . It is probably Italian from the 5th or 6th century , and the label it carried in 1712 saying it was a relic of St Leobinus , a bishop of Chartes who died in about 556 , may be correct . The other examples are mostly in Greek or the Coptic language and contain a variety of biblical texts , especially psalters . Julian Brown concludes that the three Latin manuscripts of John \" seem to attest an early medieval practice of placing a complete Gospel of St. John in a shrine , as a protective amulet ; and it seems reasonable to conclude that our manuscript was placed in St. Cuthbert 's coffin to protect it \" ."

As arthropods they have : segmented bodies with jointed limbs , all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins ; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during the development of the embryo . Being chelicerates , their bodies consist of two tagmata , sets of segments that serve similar functions : the foremost one , called the cephalothorax or prosoma , is a complete fusion of the segments that in an insect would form two separate tagmata , the head and thorax ; the rear tagma is called the abdomen or opisthosoma . In spiders , the cephalothorax and abdomen are connected by a small cylindrical section , the pedicel . The pattern of segment fusion that forms chelicerates ' heads is unique among arthropods , and what would normally be the first head segment disappears at an early stage of development , so that chelicerates lack the antennae typical of most arthropods . In fact , chelicerates ' only appendages ahead of the mouth are a pair of chelicerae , and they lack anything that would function directly as \" jaws \" .

The Lancaster team 's momentum escalated during the 1909 season , and in July of that year , Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention . \" The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been the talk of the league \" , the paper stated . \" Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened , but the plucky Red Roses manager has been ' sawing wood ' and not talking \" .

Indeed , the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a \" live wire \" back in February 1909 , when he \" grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies , and had them all sign contracts \" . Highlights of the season may have included an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies , which was scheduled to be held in Lancaster on April 2 , 1909 ."

It is the state bird of Alaska . In the summer the birds are largely brown , with dappled plumage , but in the winter they are white with some black feathers in their tails ( British populations do not adopt a winter plumage ) . The species has remained little changed from the bird that roamed the tundra during the Pleistocene . Nesting takes place in the spring when clutches of four to ten eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground . The chicks are precocial and soon leave the nest and while they are young , both parents play a part in caring for them . The chicks eat insects and young plant growth while the adults are completely herbivorous , eating leaves , flowers , buds , seeds and berries during the summer and largely subsisting on the buds and twigs of willow and other dwarf shrubs and trees during the winter ."

Kartikeya , also known as Kumara , Skanda , Saravanabhava , Visakha or Mahasena , is a god of war . The Kushan Empires and the Yaudheyas had his likeness minted in coins that they issued in the last centuries BCE . The deity 's popularity has waned in North India but has survived in South India . In South India , he became known as Subrahmaniya and was eventually fused with another local god of war known as Murukan among Tamils . Murukan is known independently from Sangam literature dated from the 2nd century BCE to the 6th century CE . Along the way , a number of legends were woven about the deity ’ s birth , accomplishments , and marriages , including one to a tribal princess known amongst Tamil and Sinhalese sources as Valli . The Skanda Purana , written in Sanskrit in the 7th or 8th century , is the primary corpus of all literature about him . A Tamil rendition of the Skanda Purana known as the Kandha Puranam written in the 14th century also expands on legends of Valli meeting Murukan . The Kandha Puranam plays an greater role for Sri Lankan Tamils than Tamils from India , who hardly know it ."

The harmonies in lute songs are an outgrowth of their melodic lines , while in continuo songs they define the structure . Lute songs tend to be loose and melismatic with frequent repetitions of verse fragments , while continuo songs are more closely tied to the rhythm of the text . Dissonance and chromaticism are used sparingly in lute songs while continuo songs show increasing use of chromaticism for more dramatic rather than pictorial underscoring . Generally , English composers were more concerned with capturing verbal rhythms than producing dramatic effects . ( Hughes noted that Restoration lyrics typified Baroque figures of speech in their use of florid lyrics . ) Use of these techniques in England indicate their adoption from Italy , where they were first used . Previously , it had been thought that English composers either didn 't know about them , or weren 't interested . But a comparison of Drexel 4257 with another of Gamble 's books in the British Library , Additional 11608 , where some of the songs appear in an embellished form , indicate that British composers and singers did occasionally adopt a more florid style ."

It was envisaged that the Supreme Allied Commander would be British , and the usual practice was for the commander and the chief of staff to be of the same nationality , so it was decided to appoint a British officer for the role of chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander ( Designate ) ( COSSAC ) , with an American deputy . In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC . Brigadier General Ray Barker became his American deputy . Initially , Morgan 's staff consisted of an aide , two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters . Morgan established his headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St James 's Square . However , by October 1943 , it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs , which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks .

Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that \" Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career , but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best . Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy , the woman she plays here , is written on that prim , lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze \" . Later that year , Streep played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation , playing the mother of Renée Zellweger and wife of William Hurt in One True Thing . The film was well received by critics . Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared , \" After ' One True Thing ' , critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined . She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she 's able to give us a woman who 's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable . \" Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep 's role \" is one of the least self @-@ consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career , but that she \" adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [ her performance ] one of her most moving . \""

Although he was influenced by French Symbolism , Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors . Together with Lady Gregory , Martyn , and other writers including J. M.

Snow 's personality in XIII , which carried over to XIII @-@ 2 , was created to be passionate , optimistic and impulsive , opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning 's cold mannerisms . He has also been described in interviews as the \" tough guy \" type , and not having a jealous side to him . He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type , but this was changed to his \" big brother \" persona . Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns , Kitase described Snow as \" struggling with all his might to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah . \" His design was intended to reflect the state of the world , as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world 's fate . His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic . Watanabe enjoyed writing the character 's story , as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared \" cool \" , rather than taking on a \" thankless \" roles . VideoGamer.com 's Wesley Yin @-@ Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope , and the way he coped with Serah 's fate , one of the most interesting aspects of the original game . Aside from his appearance in the XIII games , the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII , and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in Final Fantasy XIV : A Realm Reborn along with Lightning 's Guardian Corps uniform . Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese ."

The match was played in a strong wind , to the extent that when Frederick Maddison took a corner kick for Wanderers , the gale blew the ball back out of play .

In the second half the Old Etonians had the wind in their favour and had the better of the play . Around five minutes after the interval , a corner kick to the Etonians led to a \" scrimmage \" ( a term in common use at the time to describe a group of players struggling to gain possession of the ball ) in front of their opponents ' goal , which resulted in the ball and a number of players being forced over the goal @-@ line , uprooting the goalposts in the process .

Most of the known specimens were collected from India , with more specimens from the Gulf of Oman , Borneo , and Java . There are also less reliable records from the South China Sea , other parts of Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and the Philippines , New Guinea , and northern Australia . This species inhabits inshore waters . Several older sources reported that it could be found in rivers such as the Hooghli River and the Saigon River . These reports may have confused a river shark ( Glyphis sp . ) for the Pondicherry shark ; if accurate , they would suggest this species to be tolerant of low salinity .

At Carole 's behest , Burt becomes something of a father figure to Finn , taking him to ball games , though this development does not sit well with Kurt , who works to win his father 's attention back from Finn by emulating his father 's dress and interests before Burt realizes how hurt Kurt is . The relationship between Burt and Carole progresses to the point that they decide to live together , and she and Finn move in with the Hummels , since their house is the larger of the two . However , after Finn uses a homophobic slur against Kurt , Burt tells Finn that his behavior is unacceptable and he cannot live in the house any more , imperiling his romance with Carole . Following his appearance in this episode , O 'Malley spoke of future reconciliation between Burt and Finn . He stated , \" One of the things I think is really important in life and for human beings is to forgive and be able to rise up from our mistakes . I 'm hoping that Finn and Burt are able to cross that chasm . \""

The Royal Commission 's primary concerns were with illegitimacy ( or \" bastardy \" ) , reflecting the influence of Malthusians , and the fear that the practices of the Old Poor Law were undermining the position of the independent labourer . Two practices were of particular concern : the \" roundsman \" system , where overseers hired out paupers as cheap labour , and the Speenhamland system , which subsidised low wages without relief .

Writer Lyman B. Hagen responds to Gilbert 's criticism by stating that Angelou had been a poet long before she began writing prose and that Angelou 's audience is comfortable with her sparse lines . He insists that Angelou 's critics have missed the power of her poems ' message in her apparently simple lines . Hagen calls Angelou 's poetry light verse . He states that she writes about ordinary objects and experiences , and with deep feelings , about a variety of racial themes and concerns ."

Talented individuals who might , in an earlier time , have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business , law , the natural sciences , and even creative writing ; this drains sociology of much needed potential . \" Horowitz cites the lack of a ' core discipline ' as exacerbating the problem .

Two sections of new highway were planned from DE 8 to State Street north of downtown Dover , and from the DuPont Highway in Little Heaven north to Bay Road at what is now DE 1 's interchange with DE 9 ( Bayside Drive ) at the southern end of Dover Air Force Base . The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing . Between December 1931 and the end of 1933 , DSHD constructed a causeway across 3 @,@ 150 feet ( 960 m ) of the marsh on the east bank of the river , a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway . A Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1934 . Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide concrete pavement starting in 1934 . US 113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass north to US 13 ( State Street ) when the new highway opened for Memorial Day in 1935 .

Next day they camped at 89 ° 45 ′ S , 15 nautical miles ( 28 km ) from the pole . On the following day , 14 December 1911 , with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled in front of the sledges , and at around 3 pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole . They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau \" King Haakon VII 's Plateau \" . Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement : \" Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes .

Nevertheless , Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation , but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion . In analysing the content of the programme , they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact . Thus , they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality . The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera , including the parts of the interviews that were not included in the broadcast version of the programme . It found , with two exceptions , that the witnesses ' statements were fairly represented in the programme . The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning , when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not ; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members , when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements .

The song features fuzz effects , repetitive lyrics , and no percussion or drums . \" Box Elder \" , an ironic song about someone wanting to move to Box Elder , Montana , was considered by Gerald Cosloy to be an example of Malkmus 's \" honest , direct , and simplistic \" lyrical style , and features greater influence from pop music than the rest of the EP . \" Maybe Maybe \" features distorted guitars and indiscernible vocals , and \" Price Yeah ! \" has a sound typical of hardcore punk . The band 's hometown of Stockton inspired the band 's lyrics and sound . Malkmus stated that \" There 's something empty about Stockton .

Hashino said that \" to accomplish that , we tried to give the players of Persona 4 a definite goal and a sense of purpose that would keep motivating them as they played through the game . The murder mystery plot was our way of doing that . \" The plot of Persona 4 was \" greatly inspired \" , according to Hashino , by mystery novelists such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , Agatha Christie and Seishi Yokomizo . Persona 4 was officially unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu in March 2008 . An article in the issue detailed the game 's murder mystery premise , rural setting , and new weather forecast system . The game 's North American release date was announced at the 2008 Anime Expo in Los Angeles , California . Atlus would not make an add @-@ on disc or epilogue for Persona 4 , as had been done with the Persona 3 FES . Persona 4 allowed players full control of characters in battle . This was due to negative comments from players about most of the player team in Persona 3 being controlled by the game 's AI . The amount of data the team ended up incorporating around school life , character relationships and spoke character dialogue was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto a single disc . The anime cutscenes were produced by Studio Hibari ."

A number of Dylan biographers , including Colin Irwin , Robert Shelton and Andy Gill , have suggested that the song 's title makes reference to Arthur Rimbaud 's poem \" My Bohemian Life ( Fantasy ) \" , in which Rimbaud refers to himself as \" Tom Thumb in a daze . \" In addition , some commentators have suggested that there may be a musical reference in the lines \" And she takes your voice / And leaves you howling at the moon , \" since \" Howlin ' at the Moon \" is the title of a song by Hank Williams , a musician who Dylan admired ."

Matching folds are still evident on the two pages , suggesting it could be the copy that eyewitnesses say Lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony .

Grimestone eventually commits suicide by shooting himself in his bathroom , as did Stone in 1883 . His daughter Eleanor parallels Clara Stone Hay , and Keenan 's descriptions of Eleanor make it clear she is , like Clara , heavyset . The character Archibald Hilliard is modeled after Hay , and the description of his appearance is that of Hay even to the mustache . Hilliard was a secretary to a high official in Washington , and later a diplomat and editor , entering journalism in the same year as Hay . Hilliard becomes a brilliant writer at the Atlas , a reforming New York paper like the Tribune , under the editorship of Horatio Blackdaw , that is , Tribune editor Whitelaw Reid . Although she is not physically attractive to him , Hilliard woos Eleanor , convincing himself he is not merely a fortune seeker ."

In turn , the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path , despite never having made landfall .

Scott considered returning to the series he created with his 1979 science fiction horror film Alien , to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins of the series 's Alien creatures , and the \" space jockey \" — the extraterrestrial being , who briefly appears in Alien , as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship . Alien star Sigourney Weaver also expressed interest in returning to the series . Aliens director James Cameron discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott , and began working with another writer on a story for the film . It was then that 20th Century Fox approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series 's monsters against the title characters of the Predator films ; this project became the 2004 science fiction film Alien vs. Predator . After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover , Cameron stopped working on his own project , believing the crossover would \" kill the validity of the franchise . \" In 2006 , Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the Alien sequel project , believing that the series was Fox 's asset , and he was unwilling to deal with the studio 's attempts to influence the potential sequel ."

The Old Bedford River was cut from Earith to Salters Lode , a distance of 21 miles ( 34 km ) , and provided sufficient drainage that the land could be used for summer grazing . Vermuyden published a document in 1642 , entitled Discourse touching the draining of the Great Fennes , in which he proposed the division of the fens into three zones , the North Level , the South Level , and between them , the Middle Level , stretching from Morton 's Leam to the Bedford River . An Act of Parliament , the Pretended Act , was obtained in 1649 , and work began under his supervision . The New Bedford River was constructed , running parallel to the Old , and the Middle Levels area was protected . The Forty Foot , Twenty Foot and Sixteen Foot Rivers were cut soon afterwards , to drain water from the area to Salters Lode and Welches Dam . In addition to these new channels , the Middle Level also contained 26 miles ( 42 km ) of the old course of the Nene , and the ancient artificial waterways of King 's Dyke and Whittlesey Dyke , which connect Stanground to Floods Ferry . To the north is Well Creek , most of which was a natural waterway , although the final section to Salters Lode Lock follows the course of the New Podyke , a drainage channel constructed in the early sixteenth century .

However , in early May these directives were radically changed at the insistence of General Montgomery ; he argued that with Allied forces landing separately at either end of the island , the defending Axis forces would have the opportunity to defeat each Allied Army in turn before both could unite . Instead , the plans were altered to land both the Eighth and Seventh Armies simultaneously along a 100 miles ( 160 km ) stretch of coastline on Sicily 's south @-@ eastern corner .

On 15 October , in a meeting in the Palazzo Venezia , he made the final decision to invade Greece . His initial goal was the occupation of Corfu , Zante and Cephalonia . After the fall of Greece , in early April 1941 , the invaders divided its lands into three occupation zones ; the Italians occupied much of the country , including the Ionians . Mussolini informed General Carlo Geloso that the Ionian Islands would form a separate Italian province through a de facto annexation , but the Germans would not approve it . The Italian authorities nevertheless continued to prepare the ground for the annexation . Finally , on 22 April 1941 , after discussions between the German and Italian rulers , German führer Adolf Hitler agreed that Italy could proceed with a de facto annexation of the islands .

Together they produced Cynara ( a setting of words by Ernest Dowson ) , A Late Lark ( a setting of W. E.

The violin sonata incorporates the first , incomprehensible , melody that Delius had attempted to dictate to Fenby before their modus operandi had been worked out .

The fleet would be supported by the Regia Aeronautica and the German Fliegerkorps X ( 10th Air Corps ) . This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan ; the engagement began when the Italian 3rd Division — comprising the two Trento @-@ class heavy cruisers and Bolzano and commanded by Vice Admiral Luigi Sansonetti — encountered the British 15th Cruiser Squadron . Iachino attempted to maneuver Vittorio Veneto to the east of the British cruisers while they were distracted with Sansonetti 's cruisers , but HMS Orion spotted the battleship before she could close the trap . Vittorio Veneto immediately opened fire and quickly found the range , but only inflicted splinter damage on Orion , which fled to the south , back toward the main British fleet . Misfires in Vittorio Veneto 's forward @-@ most turret forced her to cease firing temporarily . The Italian gunners quickly returned the guns to action , however , and resumed their bombardment of the British cruisers . Poor visibility and smokescreens hampered the accuracy of Vittorio Veneto 's gunners and they scored no hits , though they straddled the cruisers several times . In the course of this phase of the battle , she had fired 92 rounds from her main battery ."

In the first step , a ubiquitin @-@ activating enzyme ( known as E1 ) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule . This is then transferred to E1 's active @-@ site cysteine residue in concert with the adenylylation of a second ubiquitin . This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme , ubiquitin @-@ conjugating enzyme ( E2 ) . In the last step , a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein . A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers ( in the form of a polyubiquitin chain ) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid . It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system . The number of E1 , E2 , and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type , but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans , indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system ."

However , smaller festivals such as the Chicago Gospel Music Festival have been hosted at the Pavilion since 2005 . There has been public opinion that some of the Blues and Jazz Festival smaller events should be moved to the better and more modern acoustics of the Pavilion . By 2009 , as the city grappled with a budget deficit , it considered realigning parts of the larger festivals with the more modern venue and made definite plans to move some of the smaller ones there ."

The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept . In 1904 , Friedeberg , speaking for the FVdG , advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon in the hands of the proletariat and would be the last step before the socialist revolution . In 1905 , his speech on the topic was even more radical . He claimed that historical materialism , a pillar of Marxism , was to blame for social democracy 's alleged powerlessness , and introduced the alternative concept of historical psychism — which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions . He also recommended the anarchist literature especially Kropotkin 's writings rather than Marx 's works , which were most influential in the SPD ."

Protosevich explained , \" It gets into this whole idea of there being two kinds of monsters .

Ultimately , the two of them clash and Jason becomes an honorable monster . \" Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift , who wrote the final draft of the film , disagreed about making Jason a hero , although they drew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a victim .

The game developed slowly ; the first rules were drafted in October 1873 , and only consisted of twelve guidelines . Even though the number of teams participating in the sport increased , the game was still effectively controlled by the College of New Jersey , who claimed eight national championships in ten years .

Often identified as the film 's deuteragonist , Taylor Orci of The Atlantic felt that \" Nala is really the agent of change in The Lion King \" , dismissing Simba as a \" rich , lazy boyfriend . \" Leab observed that The Lion King 's male characters tend to \" take the center stage \" while \" female characters take a backseat to the action . \" Lenka Křivánková of Masaryk University wrote in her thesis \" 1990s Hollywood Break @-@ Away Hits : A Feminist Perspective \" that she was not particularly surprised by the film 's lack of strong roles for women because of its Shakespearean source material , dubbing the film \" an old traditional fairy tale with all its traditional features \" , including patriarchy and monarchism . Writing for the University of Waterloo 's Kinema , Vicky Wong believes that Nala reinforces the film 's \" take your place \" motif , reminding main character Simba of his responsibilities . In his book Retelling Stories , Framing Culture : Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children 's Literature , author John Stephens credits Nala with teaching Simba about responsibility – \" the lesson the hero must learn before he can become an adult \" ."

With the revolution , the concept of common good gave way to that of popular sovereignty , as theorized by Moreno , Castelli and Monteagudo , among others . This idea held that , in the absence of a legitimate authority , the people had the right to appoint their own leaders . Over time , popular sovereignty would give way to the idea of majority rule . This maturation of ideas was gradual , taking many decades to crystallize into stable electoral and political systems , but it was what ultimately led to the adoption of the republican system as the form of government for Argentina . Domingo Faustino Sarmiento stated similar views in his Facundo , and noted that cities were more receptive to republican ideas , while rural areas were more resistant to them , which led to the surge of caudillos ."

Despite the mixed reviews and difficulties of the tour , Bono considered PopMart to be \" better than Zoo TV aesthetically , and as an art project it is a clearer thought . \" He later explained , \" When that show worked , it was mindblowing . \" A highlight of the tour was the concert in Sarajevo where U2 were the first major group to perform there following the Bosnian War . Mullen described the concert as \" an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life , and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show , and have done that , I think it would have been worthwhile . \" Bono called the show \" one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life \" .

    "text": "In this phase , water vapor condenses on various nuclei present in the air , forming the cumulus cloud . This creates the characteristic flat @-@ bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds . The size of the cloud depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and the presence of any inversions . During the convection , surrounding air is entrained ( mixed ) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases . Rain forms in a cumulus cloud via a process involving two non @-@ discrete stages . The first stage occurs after the droplets coalesce onto the various nuclei . Langmuir writes that surface tension in the water droplets provides a slightly higher pressure on the droplet , raising the vapor pressure by a small amount . The increased pressure results in those droplets evaporating and the resulting water vapor condensing on the larger droplets . Due to the extremely small size of the evaporating water droplets , this process becomes largely meaningless after the larger droplets have grown to around 20 to 30 micrometres , and the second stage takes over . In the accretion phase , the raindrop begins to fall , and other droplets collide and combine with it to increase the size of the raindrop . Langmuir was able to develop a formula which predicted that the droplet radius would grow unboundedly within a discrete time period ."

Several theoretical models have been developed to explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum . These models derive from those formulated by David Marr and James Albus , based on the observation that each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different types of input : one comprises thousands of weak inputs from the parallel fibers of the granule cells ; the other is an extremely strong input from a single climbing fiber . The basic concept of the Marr – Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a \" teaching signal \" , which induces a long @-@ lasting change in the strength of parallel fiber inputs . Observations of long @-@ term depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type , but their validity remains controversial ."

British label Rough Trade Records was impressed by the songs and released them as a January 2001 EP titled The Modern Age .

Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats , whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites . Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972 , he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then . Soon after his inauguration , he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force , which worked with local leaders — both white and black — to determine how to integrate local schools . Agnew had little interest in the work , and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz . Federal aid was available , and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees . By September 1970 , less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools . By 1971 , however , tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities , with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance . Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use ."

Meanwhile , the New South Wales Government was looking to curb flower and plant collecting from the wild , and considered prohibition in 1944 , but after witnessing the ability of Parry to manage and develop cultivation , introduced compulsory licences for wildflower collecting the following year . With his wife Olive , Percy promoted and developed knowledge over fifty years and received the Order of Australia medal in 1981 . Following on from the Parrys were Howard Gay and Arch Dennis , who pioneered growing waratahs at Monbulk in the Dandenong Ranges in the 1940s , Sid Cadwell and Frank Stone , who did likewise in Dural and the Blue Mountains respectively .

Early in the book Bette is \" captée \" ( \" bewitched \" ) by Valérie , and quickly declares to her : \" Je vous aime , je vous estime , je suis à vous ! \" ( \" I love you , I esteem you , I am wholly yours ! \" ) This affection may have been platonic , but neighbors of the Marneffes – along with many readers – suspect that their bond transcends friendship . As with Steinbock , Bette and Valérie assume butch and femme roles ; the narration even mentions \" Le contraste de la mâle et sèche nature de la Lorraine avec la jolie nature créole de Valérie \" ( \" The contrast between Lisbeth 's dry masculine nature and Valerie 's creole prettiness \" ) . The homoeroticism evolves through the novel , as Bette feeds on Valérie 's power to seduce and control the Hulot men . As one critic says : \" Valérie 's body becomes , at least symbolically , the locus of Bette 's only erotic pleasure . \""

There were few cases of mass civil disorder , France was not required to reinforce the troops stationed in Morocco , and the export of raw materials and labour for the war effort continued . Although they were never able to completely stem the flow of arms , despite considerable effort , the French were able to limit the supply of machine guns and artillery . The tribes were thus unable to face the French in direct confrontation and had to continue to rely on ambushes and raids . This contrasted with the Spanish experience in the Rif War of 1920 – 26 , in which tribes with access to such weapons were able to inflict defeats upon the Spanish Army in the field , such as at the Battle of Annual ."

In 1260 – 1261 , sultans Qutuz or Baybars replaced Ali or Abu Bakr with Isa ibn Muhanna , who was granted Sarmin and half of Salamiyah as his iqtaʿ .

Baybars did not accord Ahmad ibn Tahir a share but gave him iqta 'at elsewhere in Syria , whereas Zamil opened a rebellion against Isa . The latter called for Mamluk support and Zamil was consequently apprehended by Mamluk troops from Aleppo . He was imprisoned in Cairo but soon after released after Baybars mediated between him , Isa and other Banu Rabi 'ah emirs . A further challenge to Isa came from his powerful kinsman , Ahmad ibn Hajji of Al Mira , who eventually desisted from confronting Isa when Baybars gave him virtual independence in the southern Syrian Desert .

His treatise , Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody , published in 1584 when he was aged 18 , was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue , to which he applied Renaissance principles . He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians , later called the Castalian Band , which included William Fowler ( c . 1560 – 1612 ) , John Stewart of Baldynneis ( c . 1545 – c . 1605 ) , and Alexander Montgomerie ( c . 1550 – 98 ) . They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms , including sonnets and short sonnets , for narrative , nature description , satire and meditations on love . Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander ( c . 1567 – 1640 ) , Alexander Craig ( c . 1567 – 1627 ) and Robert Ayton ( 1570 – 1627 ) .

    "text": "Further developments in welding steel with GMAW led to a variation known as short @-@ circuit transfer ( SCT ) or short @-@ arc GMAW , in which the current is lower than for the globular method . As a result of the lower current , the heat input for the short @-@ arc variation is considerably reduced , making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area . As in globular welding , molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode , but instead of dropping to the weld pool , they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool as a result of the lower wire feed rate . This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc , but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip . This process is repeated about 100 times per second , making the arc appear constant to the human eye . This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation , and allows for welding in all positions , albeit with slower deposition of weld material . Setting the weld process parameters ( volts , amps and wire feed rate ) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc : generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications . Also , using short @-@ arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials , due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool . Like the globular variation , it can only be used on ferrous metals ."

For example , the Spanish Dancer nudibranch ( genus Hexabranchus ) , among the largest of tropical marine slugs , potently chemically defended , and brilliantly red and white , is nocturnal and has no known mimics .

Catholic doctrine teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus . Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire , despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion . Emperor Constantine legalised the practice of Christianity in 313 , and it became the state religion in 380 . Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries , many of whom had previously adopted Arian Christianity , eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries ."

Egbert followed it up by sending Æthelwulf with Eahlstan , Bishop of Sherborne , and Wulfheard , Ealdorman of Hampshire , with a large army into Kent to expel sub @-@ king Baldred . Æthelwulf was descended from kings of Kent , and he was sub @-@ king of Kent , and of Surrey , Sussex and Essex , which were then included in the sub @-@ kingdom , until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839 . His sub @-@ kingship is recorded in charters , in some of which King Egbert acted with his son 's permission , such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester , and Æthelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year . Unlike their Mercian predecessors , who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance , Æthelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests . In Abels 's view , Egbert and Æthelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters . Historians take differing views on the attitude of the new regime to the Kentish church . At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester , and according to the historian of Anglo @-@ Saxon England Simon Keynes , Egbert and Æthelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred . However , the medievalist Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred 's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability . Æthelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces ; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years ; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia ."

Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima started writing the original mythology for the Fabula Nova Crystallis series in 2003 , finishing it by February 2004 . During his work , he received creative input from game producers Hashimoto and Kitase , as well as Nomura , Motomu Toriyama and Hajime Tabata .

The most influential modern physical theories of consciousness are based on psychology and neuroscience .

Although Paley had occasionally used Perpendicular features in his churches , these were used much more frequently , so much so that the practice is credited with playing a part in what Brandwood et al. term the \" Perpendicular revival in the North \" , and even with playing a \" nationally pioneering role \" in the \" rehabilitation of the Perpendicular style as an acceptable stylistic choice \" .

    "text": "Predator @-@ prey interactions are an introductory concept into food @-@ web studies as well as behavioural ecology . Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators , such as avoid , flee , or defend . Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed . To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats , organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history , such as growth , feeding , mating , socializing , or modifying their habitat . Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation , optimization , or efficiency . For example , \" [ t ] he threat @-@ sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk \" or \" [ t ] he optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized , which depends on the prey 's initial fitness , benefits obtainable by not fleeing , energetic escape costs , and expected fitness loss due to predation risk . \""

The reasons behind the length of time are associated with the distance from the breeding site to food . First , there are few predators at the nesting colonies , therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly . Second , the time between feedings is long due to the distance from the nest site that adults forage , thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death . The duration between feedings vary among species and during the stages of development . Small feeds are frequent during the guard phase , but afterward become less frequent . However , each feed can deliver a large amount of energy ; both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night , probably when fed by both parents ."

J.D.B. was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies . A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school , where he was interrogated by the investigator , a uniformed police officer , and school officials .

During the trial , attempts to suppress the statements given by J.D.B. because he was not given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J.D.B. was not in police custody . The case was appealed and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case . Sotomayor 's opinion for the Court held that a child 's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis . Her opinion underscored the dangers of not applying age to the custody analysis , writing : \" to hold ... that a child 's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody — and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults — would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that Miranda guarantees to adults \" . The opinion cited Stansbury v.

It was initially thought that the ears of pakicetids were adapted for underwater hearing , but , as would be expected from the anatomy of the rest of this creature , the ears of pakicetids are specialized for hearing on land .

    "text": "The background for the Triangle Link was the desire to have a fixed link between the islands of Stord and Bømlo . The first documented proposals were made in the 1960s and involved building a pontoon bridge across Stokksundet . Following the 1982 opening of the Vardø Tunnel — the first subsea tunnel in Norway — Engineer Finn Nitter d.e. proposed a fixed link between the two islands . It would have crossed Digernessundet on a suspension bridge and continued along a causeway and low bridge onwards to a 2 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometer @-@ long ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) subsea tunnel under Spissøysundet and a low bridge over Gassasundet . In addition , a 7 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometer ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) long tunnel would have been built from Føyno to Ulveråker in Sveio . The company Johannes Sørlie launched an all @-@ tunnel proposal in 1985 , estimated to cost 700 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) and which would have resulted in 18 kilometers ( 11 mi ) of subsea tunnel connecting Bømlo , Stord and the mainland . An inter @-@ municipal committee was positive to the proposals , while Josef Martinsen , director of Hordaland Public Roads Administration , stated that the project was unrealistic .

Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace , and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings . Gradually , the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace . Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over , but it bounced before reaching a fielder .

    "text": "Initially , by analogy with the neutron magic number 126 , the next proton shell was also expected to occur at element 126 , too far away from the synthesis capabilities of the mid @-@ 20th century to achieve much theoretical attention . In 1966 , new values for the potential and spin @-@ orbit interaction in this region of the periodic table contradicted this and predicted that the next proton shell would occur instead at element 114 , and that nuclides in this region would be as stable against spontaneous fission as many heavy nuclei such as lead @-@ 208 . The expected closed neutron shells in this region were at neutron number 184 or 196 , thus making 298Fl and 310Fl candidates for being doubly magic . 1972 estimates predicted a half @-@ life of about a year for 298Fl , which was expected to be near a large island of stability with the longest half @-@ life at darmstadtium @-@ 294 ( 1010 years , comparable to that of 232Th ) . After the synthesis of the first isotopes of elements 112 through 118 at the turn of the 21st century , it was found that the synthesized neutron @-@ deficient isotopes were stabilized against fission . In 2008 it was thus hypothesized that the stabilization against fission of these nuclides was due to their being oblate nuclei , and that a region of oblate nuclei was centred on 288Fl . Additionally , new theoretical models showed that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f7 / 2 ( filled at element 114 ) and 2f5 / 2 ( filled at element 120 ) was smaller than expected , so that element 114 no longer appeared to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell . The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around 306Ubb , but the expected low half @-@ life and low production cross section of this nuclide makes its synthesis challenging . Nevertheless , the island of stability is still expected to exist in this region of the periodic table , and nearer its centre ( which has not been approached closely enough yet ) some nuclides , such as 291Uup and its alpha- and beta @-@ decay daughters , may be found to decay by positron emission or electron capture and thus move into the centre of the island . Due to the expected high fission barriers , any nucleus within this island of stability decays exclusively by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and beta decay , both of which would bring the nuclei closer to the beta stability line where the island is expected to be . Electron capture is needed to reach the island , which is problematic because it is not certain that electron capture becomes a major decay mode in this region of the chart of nuclides ."

When annuals , such plants grow with great rapidity and may flower and set seed within weeks , aiming to complete their development before the last vestige of water dries up . For perennial plants , reproduction is more likely to be successful if the seed germinates in a shaded position , but not so close to the parent plant as to be in competition with it .

The Eskimos ' dynasty dominated the league , losing a total of only six games during the three seasons from 1979 to 1981 . The 1981 Grey Cup was expected to be yet another easy win for Edmonton , who posted a 14 – 1 – 1 record during the season and were considered overwhelming favourites against the 5 – 11 Ottawa Rough Riders . The first half did not go as Edmonton hoped , though , as Ottawa emerged with a 20 – 1 lead .

    "text": "People have lived in the Everglades region for thousands of years . Within the past 100 years however , they have changed the natural landscape dramatically . Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land . The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades . The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially , causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades . By the 1990s , the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment . The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre @-@ drainage conditions as possible . It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history ."

His decision to rely on Russia has been often criticized . Poniatowski saw Russia as a \" lesser evil \" – willing to support the independence of a weak Poland within the Russian sphere of influence ; however in the end Russia chose to support the partitions of Poland rather than reform . He was accused by others of weakness and subservience , even of treason , especially in the years following the Second Partition ; during the Kościuszko Uprising , some rumors claimed that Polish Jacobins were planning a coup d 'état and his assassination . Another line of criticism alleged poor financial planning on his part . Poniatowski had little personal wealth ; most of his income came from royal lands and monopolies . His patronage of the arts and sciences was a major drain on his treasury ; he also supported numerous public initiatives , and attempted to use the royal treasury to cover the country 's expenses when tax revenue was insufficient . The Sejm promised to compensate him several times , with little practical effect . Nonetheless the accusation of being a spendthrift was frequently levied at him by his contemporary critics ."

    "text": "Human language has the properties of productivity , recursivity , and displacement , and relies entirely on social convention and learning . Its complex structure affords a much wider range of expressions than any known system of animal communication . Language is thought to have originated when early hominins started gradually changing their primate communication systems , acquiring the ability to form a theory of other minds and a shared intentionality . This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume , and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions . Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain , but especially in Broca 's and Wernicke 's areas . Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood , and children generally speak fluently when they are approximately three years old . The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture . Therefore , in addition to its strictly communicative uses , language also has many social and cultural uses , such as signifying group identity , social stratification , as well as social grooming and entertainment ."

After Australia took a 97 run lead , Lindwall took 3 / 104 to help leave the tourists with a victory target of 177 . This was not before dour English all rounder Trevor Bailey attempted to stone @-@ wall an Australian victory by batting for over four hours for 38 runs . Along with Miller , the pair took 14 wickets between them , displaying their pivotal role in Australia 's bowling attack , especially in the absence of the injured Johnston , who was unavailable for most of the tour . Hutton ordered Bedser and Bailey to bowl leg theory from a long run , sending balls down the leg side to prevent the Australians from scoring . England held on for a draw with Australia 30 runs short when time ran out . The teams met at The Oval for the deciding Test and Australia could manage 275 after winning the toss with Lindwall striking a quickfire 62 noted for an array of off drives to top score and push the total to respectability . Lindwall then took 4 / 70 but it was not enough to prevent England taking a 31 run lead . Australia collapsed for 162 in the second innings , with the Surrey spin twins of Jim Laker and Tony Lock taking nine wickets between them . This left England 132 to win , something they achieved with eight wickets intact . Lindwall was unable to remove any of the Englishmen ."

If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C , they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy . Guinea pigs require about 10 mg of vitamin C daily ( 20 mg if pregnant ) , which can be obtained through fresh , raw fruits and vegetables ( such as broccoli , apple , cabbage , carrot , celery , and spinach ) or through dietary supplements . Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , and hydrogen ions ; adequate amounts of vitamins E , A , and D are also necessary . Imbalanced diets have been associated with muscular dystrophy , metastatic calcification , difficulties with pregnancy , vitamin deficiencies , and teeth problems . Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables , having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume , and their habits are difficult to change after maturity . They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet ; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types . A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended , as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present . Because guinea pigs ' teeth grow constantly , they routinely gnaw , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths , a common problem in rodents .

S. perplexa generally has a more faded coloration , and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones . The two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics , as Stagnicola has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls . Owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses , Phaeocollybia attenuata might be confused with M. corneipes . Phaeocollybia attenuata can readily be differentiated in the field by the long wirelike pseudorhiza extending below the substrate , and microscopically by the much more heavily ornamented limoniform @-@ globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia . Other morphologically similar species include Hypholoma udum and H. elongatum , but unlike M. corneipes , both of these agarics have smooth spores , yellow chrysocystidia , and lack metuloids . The lookalike Galerina sideroides is found in Washington , Michigan , and Sweden , where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs . It has distinct microscopic characteristics , such as a wider range of basidial widths ( 20 – 40 µm ) , and a lack of pleurocystidia ."

Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance , and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government . On December 29 , 1890 , troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee . The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux , including many women and children ; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave . In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota ; the uprising was brought to an end . Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century . Harrison 's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and , despite the massacre , he believed the policy to have been generally successful . This policy , known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act , was favored by liberal reformers at the time , but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators ."

Subfossil remains of Newton 's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features , but also had similarities , such as a reduced sternum , which suggests a close relationship . Skeletal features indicate an especially close relationship with the Alexandrine parakeet and the rose @-@ ringed parakeet ( Psittacula krameri ) , but the many derived features of Newton 's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues ."

Over the centuries that followed , these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Māori . The population was divided into iwi ( tribes ) and hapū ( subtribes ) who would sometimes cooperate , sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other . At some point , a group of Māori migrated to the Chatham Islands ( which they named Rēkohu ) where they developed their distinct Moriori culture . The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 , largely because of Taranaki Māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s , although European diseases also contributed .

    "text": "To most philosophers , the word \" consciousness \" connotes the relationship between the mind and the world . To writers on spiritual or religious topics , it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God , or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world . Krishna consciousness , for example , is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna . The mystical psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness : Simple Consciousness , awareness of the body , possessed by many animals ; Self Consciousness , awareness of being aware , possessed only by humans ; and Cosmic Consciousness , awareness of the life and order of the universe , possessed only by humans who are enlightened . Many more examples could be given . The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be Ken Wilber 's book The Spectrum of Consciousness , a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind . Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end , and more profound types of awareness at higher levels ."

For much of its first two centuries , it was , along with the Royal Opera House , a patent theatre granted rights in London for the production of drama , and had a claim to be one of London 's leading theatres . The first theatre , known as \" Theatre Royal , Bridges Street \" , saw performances by Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart . After it was destroyed by fire in 1672 , English dramatist and theatre manager Thomas Killigrew constructed a larger theatre on the same spot , which opened in 1674 .

Killigrew 's theatre lasted nearly 120 years , under leadership including Colley Cibber , David Garrick , and Richard Brinsley Sheridan . In 1791 , under Sheridan 's management , the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 ; but that survived only 15 years , burning down in 1809 .

As early as 1915 , an executive presbyter wrote in an article for the Pentecostal Evangel that segregation was \" ordained of God \" ; however , it was not until 1939 that the General Presbytery enacted a policy prohibiting the ordination of African Americans to the ministry .

Black Pentecostals seeking ordination were referred to \" one of the colored organizations \" . This was especially true of the Church of God in Christ , which , despite the fact that it predates the Assemblies of God , was seen as a \" younger sibling \" .

While the specific legends were probably not true , they were likely based on historical fact . It is likely that , before the founding of the republic , Rome actually had been ruled by a succession of kings . The first legendary epoch saw the reigns of the first four legendary kings . During this time , the political foundations of the city were laid , the city grew increasingly organized , the religious institutions were established , and the senate and the assemblies evolved into formal institutions . The early Romans were divided into three ethnic groups . The families that belonged to one of these ethnic groups were the original Patrician families . In an attempt to add a level of organization to the city , these Patrician families were divided into units called curia . The vehicle through which the early Romans expressed their democratic impulses was known as a \" committee \" ( comitia or \" assembly \" ) . The two principle assemblies that formed were known as the Curiate Assembly and the Calculate Assembly . The two assemblies were designed to mirror the ethnic divisions of the city , and as such , the assemblies were organized by curia . The vehicle through which the early Romans expressed their aristocratic impulses was a council of town elders , which became the Roman senate . The elders of this council were known as patres ( \" fathers \" ) , and thus are known to history as the first Roman senators . The demos ( \" people \" ) and the elders eventually recognized the need for a single political leader , and thus elected such a leader , the rex ( Roman King ) . The demos elected the rex , and the elders advised the rex ."

The 1902 treaty between the latter two was canceled upon the Brazilian dreadnought order so both could be free to build their own dreadnoughts . Argentina in particular was alarmed at the possible power of the ships . The Minister of Foreign Affairs , Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca , remarked that either Minas Geraes or São Paulo could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets . While this may have been hyperbole , either one was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentinian fleet . As such , the Argentines quickly responded to the dreadnoughts with an order to the United States for two of their own , the Rivadavia class , while Chile ordered two of the Almirante Latorre class from the United Kingdom ."

Electrode selection greatly influences the mechanical properties of the weld and is a key factor of weld quality . In general the finished weld metal should have mechanical properties similar to those of the base material with no defects such as discontinuities , entrained contaminants or porosity within the weld . To achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist . All commercially available electrodes contain deoxidizing metals such as silicon , manganese , titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity . Some contain denitriding metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity . Depending on the process variation and base material being welded the diameters of the electrodes used in GMAW typically range from 0 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 028 – 0 @.@ 095 in ) but can be as large as 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) .

Upon reaching the Scottish @-@ mainland , the late 13th century Hákonar saga Hákonarsonar ( \" The Saga of Hákon Hákonarson \" ) , states that Hákon levied a tax upon Caithness and considered plundering into the Moray Firth .

The fleet then made its way south along the western seaboard to Skye , where the saga records that Hákon was met by Magnús . The saga states that Hákon 's fleet then sailed south to Kerrera , where Dubgall mac Ruaidrí , King in the Isles ( d . 1268 ) and Magnús amongst others , were sent to lead fifty ships towards Kintyre , while a smaller group was sent to Bute . The fleet sent to Kintyre was likely tasked with obtaining the allegiance of Áengus mac Domnaill , Lord of Islay ( d. circa 1293 ) and a certain Murchad , both who are stated by the saga to have afterwards submitted to Hákon . The saga records that several castles were secured by Hákon 's forces : Rothesay Castle on Bute ; and an unnamed castle in southern Kintyre , which was more than likely Dunaverty Castle . At Gigha , the saga relates that Eógan surrendered himself to Hákon , and informed the Norwegian king that he had decided to side with the Scots from whom he held a larger grant of lands .

Lauded for his casting in each of his films , he claimed in an interview that \" I am not a director who performs and shows . I discuss the role , the scene with my actors and let them bring life to it \" . Right from the beginning of his career , his works were noted for their technical expertise in areas such as cinematography , art direction , editing and background score . For his debut film , he managed to handpick Balu Mahendra , Thotta Tharani , B. Lenin , and Ilaiyaraaja , leading craftsmen in their respective fields . As his career progressed , he worked with his childhood friend P. C. Sreeram and continued his collaborations with him until Geethanjali . In 1991 for his film Thalapathi , he chose Santosh Sivan and Suresh Urs — both newcomers to the Tamil film industry — to do cinematography and editing respectively . Both would later go onto become a part of his regular crew . While working on Raavan , Santosh Sivan noted \" any cameraman can hone his skills just working with [ Mani ] \" and described Mani Ratnam 's films as difficult to film . From his debut project till Thalapathi , Ilaiyaraaja was his regular composer . The duo split due to some creative differences after the film . For his next film Roja ( 1992 ) , he collaborated with debutant A. R. Rahman , who has been his regular composer for all his films till date . He has also worked with Rajiv Menon and Ravi K. Chandran , while switching between Sreeram and Santosh Sivan . Since Alaipayuthey , Sreekar Prasad has been his regular film editor ."

The line was operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) in 1876 . The Minehead Railway was itself absorbed into the GWR in 1897 . A small signal box stood at the Watchet end of the platform , but was demolished in 1926 when this was extended . In 1934 a new signal box at the opposite end of the station , brought second @-@ hand from Maerdy , was put into use when the line from Dunster to Minehead was doubled in 1934 . The GWR was nationalised into British Railways in 1948 and from 1964 , when goods traffic was withdrawn on 6 July , the line was run down until it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971 . The line was reopened as a heritage railway operated by the West Somerset Railway on 28 March 1976 . The signal box was moved to Minehead in 1977 but the goods yard is now home to the railway ’ s civil engineering team . It is a Grade II listed building ."

The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England 's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture , and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray 's poem . Some reviewers greatly praised the piece , and in particular Etty 's technical abilities , but audiences of the time found it hard to understand the purpose of Etty 's painting , and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive ."

The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts , had descended from independent bacteria that came to live symbiotically within other cells . It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted , but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s ; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell 's nucleus ."

    "text": "All volcanic seamounts follow a particular pattern of growth , activity , subsidence and eventual extinction . The first stage of a seamount 's evolution is its early activity , building its flanks and core up from the sea floor . This is followed by a period of intense volcanism , during which the new volcano erupts almost all ( e.g. 98 % ) of its total magmatic volume . The seamount may even grow above sea level to become an oceanic island ( for example , the 2009 eruption of Hunga Tonga ) . After a period of explosive activity near the ocean surface , the eruptions slowly die away . With eruptions becoming infrequent and the seamount losing its ability to maintain itself , the volcano starts to erode . After finally becoming extinct ( possibly after a brief rejuvenated period ) , they are ground back down by the waves . Seamounts are built in a far more dynamic oceanic setting than their land counterparts , resulting in horizontal subsidence as the seamount moves with the tectonic plate towards a subduction zone . Here it is subducted under the plate margin and ultimately destroyed , but it may leave evidence of its passage by carving an indentation into the opposing wall of the subduction trench . The majority of seamounts have already completed their eruptive cycle , so access to early flows by researchers is limited by late volcanic activity ."
