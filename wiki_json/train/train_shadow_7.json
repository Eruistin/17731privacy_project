By 820 he held an unspecified position at the court of Emperor Leo V the Armenian ( ruled 813 – 822 ) , possibly as a member of the imperial guard . Theoktistos played a major role in the plot to assassinate Leo , and was rewarded by the new emperor , Michael II the Amorian ( r . 822 – 829 ) , with the rank of patrikios , and the confidential court post of chartoularios tou kanikleiou ( \" secretary of the ink @-@ pot \" ) . Under Michael 's son and successor , Theophilos ( r . 829 – 842 ) , he apparently continued to be a trusted advisor , as he rose to the rank of magistros , and was appointed logothetēs tou dromou , effectively the Empire 's foreign minister .

It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over , carried on an impost consisting of a small entablature , under which , and enclosing two other lights , one on each side , are pilasters . In the library at Venice , Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters . To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate ; the motif was first used by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio ( 1475 – 1554 ) in his seven @-@ volume architectural book Tutte l 'opere d 'architettura et prospetiva expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture , this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings , a motif that first appeared in the triumphal arches of ancient Rome . Palladio used the motif extensively , most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza . It is also a feature of his entrances to both Villa Godi and Villa Forni Cerato . It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window ; it is also known as a Serlian window . Whatever the name or the origin , this form of window has probably become one of the most enduring features of Palladio 's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism . According to James Lees @-@ Milne , its first appearance in Britain was in the remodeled wings of Burlington House , London , where the immediate source was actually in Inigo Jones 's designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself ."

    "text": "Edward Stafford , Duke of Buckingham , combined multiple lines of Plantagenet descent : from Edward III by his son Thomas of Woodstock , from Edward III via two of his Beaufort children , and from Edward I from Joan of Kent and the Holland family . His father failed in his rebellion against Richard III in 1483 but was restored to his inheritance on the reversal of his father 's attainder late in 1485 . His mother married Henry VII 's uncle Jasper Tudor , and his wardship was entrusted to the king 's mother , Lady Margaret Beaufort . In 1502 , during Henry VII 's illness , there was debate as to whether Buckingham or Edmund de la Pole should act as regent for Henry VIII . There is no evidence of continuous hostility between Buckingham and Henry VIII , but there is little doubt of the duke 's dislike of Thomas Wolsey , whom he believed to be plotting to ruin the old nobility . Therefore , Henry VIII instructed Wolsey to watch Buckingham , his brother Henry Stafford , 1st Earl of Wiltshire , and three other peers . Neither Henry VIII nor his father planned to destroy Buckingham because of his lineage and Henry VIII even allowed Buckingham 's son and heir , Henry Stafford , 1st Baron Stafford , to marry Ursula Pole , giving the Staffords a further line of royal blood descent . Buckingham himself was arrested in April 1521 ; he was found guilty on 16 May and executed the next day . Evidence was provided that the duke had been listening to prophecies that he would be king and that the Tudor family lay under God 's curse for the execution of Warwick . This was said to explain Henry VIII 's failure to produce a male heir . Much of this evidence consisted of ill @-@ judged comments , speculation and bad temper , but it underlined the threat presented by Buckingham 's descent ."

He introduced aikido to the United Kingdom in 1955 , and founded the Kyushindo system . Abbe was a graduate of the Budo Senmon Gakko , having studied judo and kendo there . Following an illustrious early career in the martial arts , he served in the Imperial Japanese Army before and during World War II . He then trained in aikido under its founder , Morihei Ueshiba , for a decade . Abbe held dan ranks in several martial arts , most notably 8th dan in judo , 6th dan in aikido , and 6th dan in kendo . After introducing aikido to the UK , he established several Japanese martial arts councils there during the late 1950s . He returned to Japan in 1964 and remained there for most of the remainder of his life . There are contradictory accounts of Abbe 's final years , but it appears that he was in poor spirits and poor health towards the end ."

    "text": "Because Pride and Prejudice was a period drama , the design required more research than contemporary films . The personality and wealth of the characters were reflected in their costumes ; the wealthy Bingley sisters were never shown in print dresses and they wore big feathers in their hair . As the BBC 's stock of early 19th century costumes was limited , costume designer Dinah Collin designed most of the costumes , visiting museums for inspiration while trying to make the clothes attractive to a modern audience ( although some costumes , mostly worn by extras , were re @-@ used from earlier BBC productions or hired ) . Elizabeth 's clothes had earthy tones and were fitted to allow easy and natural movements in line with the character 's activity and liveliness . In contrast , Collin chose pale or creamy white colours for the clothes of the other Bennet girls to highlight their innocence and simplicity and richer colours for Bingley 's sisters and Lady Catherine de Bourgh . Colin Firth participated in the wardrobe decisions and wanted his character to wear darker colours , leaving the warmer colours for Bingley ."

While admitting that the dream sequence and reset button technique were arguably uninspiring clichés , in the case of \" Attack on Cloudbase \" he defended the use of such plot devices for their suitability in both initially alarming viewers ( with the apparent deaths of the main characters ) and ultimately reassuring them ( with the revelation that the attack on Cloudbase was , in the end , \" all a dream \" ) . Anderson praised Tony Barwick 's script , citing Blue and Symphony 's romantic relationship and the underlying tension between Blue and Colonel White as examples of Barwick 's \" humanisation \" of the puppet characters . Captain Magenta 's comic quality as the herald of the attack is , similarly , another \" wonderful example of ' Barwickism ' \" ."

In spite of his acute agony , Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway , placed his charges , and blew up the line in two places .

When he was two , the brothers were brought to England , where they were placed under the care of an English nanny in a house adjoining that of Eleanor 's father and mother . The boys ' parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons . Such an arrangement was then normal for middle @-@ class families based in the colonies . The lack of parental contact , and the harsh regime of some of those in loco parentis , left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds , including the writers Thackeray , Saki , Kipling and Walpole . Wodehouse was more fortunate ; his nanny , Emma Roper , was strict but not unkind , and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood . His recollection was that \" it went like a breeze from start to finish , with everybody I met understanding me perfectly \" . The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse 's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark , causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works . Another biographer , Frances Donaldson , writes , \" Deprived so early , not merely of maternal love , but of home life and even a stable background , Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own \" ."

Van Dormael 's next film , Le huitieme jour ( The Eighth Day ) , accomplishes this with the chance meeting and friendship between Georges , played by Pascal Duquenne , and Harry , an unhappy divorced businessman portrayed by Daniel Auteuil . Van Dormael 's interest in people with mental and physical disabilities stems from an interest in their \" talent for life , for loving life , that we often lack . \" He sought to explore the concept of two worlds ( that of Georges and that of Harry ) existing simultaneously and yet separately . Le huitième jour premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival , where it was nominated for the Palme d 'Or . It did win the Best Actor award at the festival , which was given to both Pascal Duquenne and Daniel Auteuil . This was the first time in the festival 's history that two actors had shared the award . The film was acclaimed by film critics and received four Joseph Plateau Awards . It was also nominated for a César Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film .

After having been registered as Ioan Ștefănescu ( a variant of his given name and a family name based on his patronymic ) , the adolescent student eventually adopted his maternal surname of Creangă . According to Călinescu , this was done either \" for aesthetic reasons \" ( as his new name , literally meaning \" branch \" or \" bough \" , \" sounds good \" ) or because of a likely discovery that Ștefan was not his real father . Dan Grădinaru , a researcher of Creangă 's work , believes that the writer had a special preference for the variant Ioan , generally used in more learned circles , instead of the variant Ion that was consecrated by his biographers ."

    "text": "The libretto has survived in numerous forms — two printed versions , seven manuscript versions or fragments , and an anonymous scenario , or summary , related to the original production . One of the printed editions relates to the opera 's 1651 Naples revival ; the other is Busenello 's final version published in 1656 as part of a collection of his libretti . The manuscripts are all from the 17th century , though not all are specifically dated ; some are \" literary \" versions unrelated to performances . The most significant of the manuscript copies is that discovered in Udine , Northern Italy , in 1997 by Monteverdi scholar Paolo Fabbri . This manuscript , according to music historian Ellen Rosand , \" bristles with the immediacy of a performance \" , and is the only copy of the libretto that mentions Monteverdi by name . This , and other descriptive details missing from other copies , leads Rosand to speculate that the manuscript was copied during the course of a performance . This impression is reinforced , she says , by the inclusion of a paean of praise to the singer ( Anna di Valerio according to Schneider ) who played the role of Poppea . Although its dating is uncertain , the manuscript 's affinity with the original scenario has led to speculation that the Udine version may have been compiled from the first performance ."

Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding , killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage . Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages , significant building damage , and major crop damage . Damage totaled roughly $ 400 million , making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades . In preparation of the system , many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect . Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated , and the governor of Florida declared a state of emergency for six counties in Florida ; this was later relinquished following the relatively minor impacts of Kate . In addition , many shelters were opened . When Kate struck the Florida Panhandle , it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975 . Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry , causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm . Gusts over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) contributed to downed trees and building damage , while a combination of the wind and rain led to downed power poles . Across the remainder of the Southeast United States , several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding , damage to roadways , and major tree damage .

A similar strategy discussion occurred on the German side , with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviets to advance , while the Germans launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition .

These creatures fed upon sediment at the bottom of ponds and avoided retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but , because food occurred in patches , it was in the worm 's interest to stay near previous trails . Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay , when to turn , and how sharp a turn to make . In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails , and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids ."

Originally , Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London , but when the papacy refused permission , Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles . Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric , and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa 's control . There were several reasons for the conflict between Jænberht and Offa . Jænberht 's opposed Offa 's deposition of the Kentish dynasty . They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs , and Jænberht refused to crown Offa 's son Ecgfrith . Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury . Matthew Paris , writing in the thirteenth century , stated that Jænberht conspired to admit Charlemagne to Canterbury if he invaded Britain . This story may reflect a genuine tradition recorded at St Albans Abbey , where Paris was based , or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of Jænberht 's life where Paris had no other information . A rumour during Jænberht 's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope Hadrian I ; at least one modern historian , Simon Keynes , believes it possible Jænberht was behind the rumour . Offa 's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa 's actions had been motivated by hatred of Jænberht and the Kentish people ."

He was succeeded by Ahmad 's brother Muhammad Tarabay , who — according to his French secretary — had good intentions for governing Lajjun , but was addicted to opium and as a result had been a weak leader . After his death in 1671 , other members of the Tarabay family ruled Lajjun until 1677 when the Ottomans replaced them with a government officer . The main reason behind the Ottoman abandonment of the Tarabays was that their larger tribe , the Bani Hareth , migrated east of Lajjun to the eastern banks of the Jordan River . Later during this century , Sheikh Ziben , ancestor to the Arrabah @-@ based Abd al @-@ Hadi clan , became the leader of Sanjak Lajjun . When Henry Maundrell visited in 1697 , he described the place as \" an old village near which was a good khan ."

Although Nomura stated that Cloud was a more positive character in Final Fantasy VII than in Advent Children , he did not believe that such an \" ' upbeat ' image of him is what stuck in the minds of the fans \" , and the script was written to explain why Cloud returned to a state of mind \" consistent with the fans ' view of him . \" Nomura describes Cloud 's life as peaceful but , hurt by the losses he experienced during the original game , one which he grew scared of losing . Blaming himself for things outside of his control , Cloud , Nomura elaborated , needed to overcome himself . In contrast to other heroes , who , in Nomura 's view , typically possess character defects amounting only to quirks , Nomura believed Cloud 's weakness to be humanizing . Nojima viewed the theme of the story as one of forgiveness , which he believed required hardship . Cloud , by taking up his sword and fighting , struggles to achieve it . Nojima sought to establish Cloud 's withdrawn personality by depicting him with a cell phone , but never answering any calls . He originally intended for Aerith 's name to be the last of those displayed while the backlog of ignored messages appears as Cloud 's cell phone sinks into the water , but Nojima altered the scene because it \" sounded too creepy \" . The wolf which Cloud imagines \" represents the deepest part of Cloud 's psyche \" and \" appears in response to some burden that Cloud is carrying deep in his heart \" , vanishing at the film 's end . Nomura cites one of the film 's final scenes , in which Cloud smiles , as his favorite , highlighting the lack of dialogue and Cloud 's embarrassment . The scene influenced composer Nobuo Uematsu 's score , who grew excited after coming across it in his review of the script , commenting on the difficulty players who had finished Final Fantasy VII would have had imagining Cloud 's smile ."

The bluebuck could adapt to more open habitats than could the roan antelope , a notable point of difference between these species . Fossils of the bluebuck have been found in the Klaises River and the Nelson Bay Caves ( near Plettenberg Bay ) and Swartklip ( to the west of the Hottentots Holland mountains ) . The aforementioned 2013 study noted that the western and southern CFR were separated by biogeographical barriers , such as the Cape Fold Belt and afromontane forests . A 2011 study suggested that low sea levels facilitated migrations for large mammals ; therefore the rise in sea levels with the beginning of the Holocene would have led to fragmented bluebuck populations and distanced many populations from the western coast ( fossils dating to this period are scarce in the western coast but have been recorded from the southern coast ) .

    "text": "The zone where land meets sea is known as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by splashing waves is the shore . A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore . A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory is known as a cape . The indentation of a coastline — especially between two headlands — is a bay ; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay @-@ shaped sea may be referred to as a gulf . Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore , the gradient of the land margin , the composition and hardness of the coastal rock , the inclination of the off @-@ shore slope , and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence . Normally , waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute . These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect . Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves , as their swash moves beach material seawards . Under their influence , the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded . Around high tide , the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure . At the same time , sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks . Along with other weathering processes such as frost , this tends to undercut the cliff . Gradually , a wave @-@ cut platform develops at the foot of the cliff and this has a protective effect , reducing further wave @-@ erosion ."

Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused , and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself , Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case ."

Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare , praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative . He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre , arguing that imaginative literature , especially narrative , was more valuable than history or biography . When it was properly done , as in Austen , Whately said , imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature ; in other words , it was moral . Whately also addressed Austen 's position as a female writer , writing : \" we suspect one of Miss Austin 's [ sic ] great merits in our eyes to be , the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female characters . ... Her heroines are what one knows women must be , though one never can get them to acknowledge it . \" No more significant , original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century : Whately and Scott had set the tone for the Victorian era 's view of Austen ."

The Roman poet Vergil shows Orion as a giant wading through the Aegean Sea with the waves breaking against his shoulders ; rather than , as the mythographers have it , walking on the water . There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in Boeotia , including Hyria ; this may well be the original story ( although not the first attested ) , since Hyrieus is presumably the eponym of Hyria . He is also called Oeneus , although he is not the Calydonian Oeneus . Other ancient scholia say , as Hesiod does , that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos ; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles . There are two versions where Artemis killed Orion , either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion . In the second variant , Orion died of the Scorpion 's sting as he does in Hesiod . Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version , several variants have it die from its wounds . Artemis is given various motives . One is that Orion boasted of his beast @-@ killing and challenged her to a contest with the discus . Another is that he assaulted either Artemis or the Hyperborean maiden Opis in her band of huntresses . Aratus 's brief description , in his Astronomy , conflates the elements of the myth : according to Aratus , Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on Chios , and the Scorpion kills him there . Nicander , in his Theriaca , has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small ( oligos ) stone . Most versions of the story that continue after Orion 's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars , but even here a variant exists : Ancient poets differed greatly as to who Aesculapius brought back from the dead ; the Argive epic poet Telesarchus is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion . Other ancient authorities are quoted anonymously that Aesculapius healed Orion after he was blinded by Oenopion ."

His last country @-@ house commission was at Packington Hall , Warwickshire . In 1761 , he published his plans of Holkham Hall , calling himself the architect , which led critics , including Horace Walpole , to decry him as a purloiner of Kent 's designs . Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine 's Gate , Norwich , and was buried in the aisle of the parish church . Throughout his long career , Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement . His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty @-@ one assorted peers and peeresses . He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington , and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop , or was not given the opportunity to develop , a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses . Ultimately , he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam . Adam remodelled Brettingham 's York House in 1780 and , in addition to Kedleston Hall , went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory , Alnwick Castle , and Syon House . In spite of this , Adam and Paine remained great friends ; Brettingham 's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded ."

According to some classical historians , the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was a direct result of the rise of slavery . Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts . The early slaves typically performed manual labor , helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts . While part of new France , laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters . Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden , and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up . Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment . Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave , the slave and her children were then to be freed . Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors ."

The style varied slightly by architect and location , but typically the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments , sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion . The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs . The graves proved controversial : initially they were marked by wooden crosses but , after some argument , it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers ; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier 's next of kin . Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name , regiment , date of death , a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the next of kin . Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s . British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries ; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials , the limited options for families to individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC in determining how the soldiers were buried ."

    "text": "The largest find of Iguanodon remains to that date occurred on 28 February 1878 in a coal mine at Bernissart in Belgium , at a depth of 322 m ( 1 @,@ 056 ft ) , when two mineworkers , Jules Créteur and Alphonse Blanchard , accidentally hit on a skeleton that they initially took for petrified wood . With the encouragement of Alphonse Briart , supervisor of mines at nearby Morlanwelz , Louis de Pauw on 15 May 1878 started to excavate the skeletons and in 1882 Louis Dollo reconstructed them . At least 38 Iguanodon individuals were uncovered , most of which were adults . In 1882 , the holotype specimen of I. bernissartensis became one of the first ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display . It was put together in a chapel at the Palace of Charles of Lorraine using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process . This specimen , along with several others , first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in July 1883 . In 1891 they were moved to the Royal Museum of Natural History , where they are still on display ; nine are displayed as standing mounts , and nineteen more are still in the Museum 's basement . The exhibit makes an impressive display in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences , in Brussels . A replica of one of these is on display at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge . Most of the remains were referred to a new species , I. bernissartensis , a larger and much more robust animal than the English remains had yet revealed , but one specimen was referred to the nebulous , gracile I. mantelli ( now Dollodon bampingi ) . The skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known . Found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants , fish , and other reptiles , including the crocodyliform Bernissartia ."

    "text": "The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection . By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner , and by throwing it at a certain speed , pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side , or downward , as it approaches the batter . Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown , the four basic types are the fastball , the changeup ( or off @-@ speed pitch ) , and two breaking balls — the curveball and the slider . Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing . Conventionally , before each pitch , the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw , as well as its general vertical and / or horizontal location . If there is disagreement on the selection , the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch . With a runner on base and taking a lead , the pitcher may attempt a pickoff , a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner 's lead in check or , optimally , effect a tag out . Pickoff attempts , however , are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher 's movements before and during the pickoff attempt . Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher , with the result being runners on base , if any , advance one base with impunity . If an attempted stolen base is anticipated , the catcher may call for a pitchout , a ball thrown deliberately off the plate , allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base . Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field , the fielding team may employ a shift , with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions . With a runner on third base , the infielders may play in , moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball , though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn @-@ in infield ."

Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee @-@ Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963 , but not all . Vee @-@ Jay finished preparation for the album Introducing ... The Beatles , culled from most of the songs of Parlophone 's Please Please Me , but a management shake @-@ up led to the album not being released . Then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on their sales , the licence Vee @-@ Jay signed with EMI was voided . A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \" She Loves You \" , but legal issues with royalties and publishing rights proved an obstacle to the successful marketing of the group in the US . American chart success began after Epstein arranged for a $ 40 @,@ 000 US marketing campaign and secured the support of disc jockey Carrol James , who first played the band 's records in mid @-@ December 1963 . Late that same month , the Beatles were introduced in the Tidewater area of Virginia by Gene Loving of radio station WGH , accompanied by a full marketing campaign , including Beatles shirt giveaways . Within days , almost every other song played on the station was a Beatles recording . It was not until the end of first week of January 1964 that their records were played in New York City ( also accompanied by a major marketing campaign and with similar play frequency ) , and then the rest of the country , initiating their music 's spread across US radio . This caused an increase in demand , leading Capitol to rush @-@ release \" I Want to Hold Your Hand \" later that month . Issued on 26 December 1963 , with the band 's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away , \" I Want to Hold Your Hand \" sold a million copies , becoming a number @-@ one hit in the US by mid @-@ January . In its wake , Vee @-@ Jay released Introducing ... The Beatles to go along with Capitol 's debut album , Meet the Beatles ! , while Swan reactivated production of \" She Loves You \" ."

The bylaws specify the design that must be used each year , and no changes have been permitted since the first burn in 2003 .

The fact that Cuthbert 's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture , indeed , might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts . On the other hand , the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert 's Latin letter , the observation that Bede \" was learned in our song , \" and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it . By citing the poem directly , Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important , either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment or because it is a direct quotation of Bede 's last original composition ."

Under Richard II it became practice to consider the Chancery separate from the curia ; academic William Carne considers this a key moment in confirming the independence of the Court of Chancery . The Chancellor and his clerks often heard the cases directly , rather than having them referred to the council itself ; occasionally a committee of lay and church members disposed of them , assisted by the judges of the common law courts . John Baker argues that it was the late 14th century that saw Chancery procedure become fixed , citing the work done by John Waltham as Master of the Rolls between 1381 and 1386 , and notes that this period also saw the first complaints about the Chancery ."

People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others . Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years , and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . It is distinguished not by a single symptom , but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction ; impairments in communication ; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior . Other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . Autism 's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits ."

Cahokia , Vincennes , and several other villages and forts in British territory were subsequently captured without firing a shot , because most of the French @-@ speaking and American Indian inhabitants were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British . To counter Clark 's advance , Henry Hamilton reoccupied Vincennes with a small force . In February 1779 , Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town , capturing Hamilton in the process . The winter expedition was Clark 's most significant military achievement and became the source of his reputation as an early American military hero . When news of his victory reached General George Washington , Clark 's success was celebrated and was used to encourage the alliance with France . Washington recognized his achievement had been gained without support from the regular army in men or funds . Virginia capitalized on Clark 's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest , calling it Illinois County ."

The contemporary British political philosopher Martin Cohen has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favour of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs , rather than vice versa , but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers . Cohen extends this argument in more detail in Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao , where he argues that the Qur 'an played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society ."

A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century , with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella . Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius , Prudentius , Claudian , and Sidonius . Ausonius ( d. ca . 394 ) , the Bordelaise tutor of the emperor Gratian , was at least nominally a Christian , though throughout his occasionally obscene mixed @-@ genre poems , he retains a literary interest in the Greco @-@ Roman gods and even druidism . The imperial panegyrist Claudian ( d . 404 ) was a vir illustris who appears never to have converted . Prudentius ( d. ca . 413 ) , born in Hispania Tarraconensis and a fervent Christian , was thoroughly versed in the poets of the Classical tradition , and transforms their vision of poetry as a monument of immortality into an expression of the poet 's quest for eternal life culminating in Christian salvation . Sidonius ( d . 486 ) , a native of Lugdunum , was a Roman senator and bishop of Clermont who cultivated a traditional villa lifestyle as he watched the Western empire succumb to barbarian incursions . His poetry and collected letters offer a unique view of life in late Roman Gaul from the perspective of a man who \" survived the end of his world \" ."

The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco @-@ Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop . Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911 .

Cooper delivered a \" powerful and persuasive \" performance of an emotionally scarred man whose need to dominate others is transformed by the love and sacrifice of a woman . In Robert Rossen 's historical adventure They Came to Cordura with Rita Hayworth , he plays an army officer who is found guilty of cowardice and assigned the degrading task of recommending soldiers for the Medal of Honor during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916 . While Cooper received positive reviews , Variety and Films in Review felt he was too old for the part . In Michael Anderson 's action drama The Wreck of the Mary Deare with Charlton Heston , Cooper plays a disgraced merchant marine officer who decides to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship in order to prove the vessel was deliberately scuttled and to redeem his good name . Like its two predecessors , the film was physically demanding . Cooper , who was a trained scuba diver , did most of his own underwater scenes .

The canals were engineered to guide the overflow of Lake Okeechobee into the St. Lucie River and then into the Atlantic Ocean in the east ; the Caloosahatchee River overflow was directed to the Gulf of Mexico in the west , and eventually canals were to be constructed south through the Everglades . Disston was advised to begin with a large canal connecting Lake Okeechobee with the St. Lucie but the prohibitive costs forced him to begin with smaller dredging operations to straighten the Kissimmee River and to connect Lake Okeechobee with the Caloosahatchee . Dredging commenced around Lake Okeechobee during the winter of 1881 – 1882 . In June 1883 , a report concluded that the Kissimmee valley was indeed drying up as Disston planned , and another report a year later reported further drainage with nearly 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reclaimed land credited to Disston ."

    "text": "Ocean surface waves are oscillations caused by the friction from air moving across the surface of the water . This friction transfers energy and forms surface waves in the water perpendicular to the direction of the wind . The top of a wave is known as its crest and its foot as its trough ; the distance between two crests is the wavelength . These waves are mechanical : as they approach , the water molecules at a given point rise up and , as they pass , the water molecules go down , tracing a roughly circular path . The energy is passed across the surface and does not represent a horizontal motion of the water itself . The sea state of the ocean is determined by the size of these waves , which — on the open ocean — depends upon the wind speed and the fetch , the distance over which the wind blows upon the water . The smallest waves are called ripples . As strong and prolonged winds push against ripples ' raised crests , larger and more irregular waves form , which known as seas . These waves reach their maximum height when the rate at which they are traveling nearly matches the speed of the wind and , over time , they naturally separate into long , powerful waves with a common direction and wavelength . These swells are particularly common in the Roaring Forties of the Southern Hemisphere where the wind blows continuously . When the wind dies down , ripples easily disappear owing to water 's surface tension , but seas and swells are only slowly reduced by gravity and destructive interference from other waves . Constructive interference , however , can also cause individual rogue waves much higher than normal . Most waves are less than 3 m ( 10 ft ) high and it is not unusual for strong storms to double or triple that height ; offshore construction such as wind farms and oil platforms use these measurements in computing the hundred @-@ year wave they are designed against . Rogue waves , however , have been documented at heights above 25 meters ( 82 ft ) ."

Some games attempted to incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games through the use of less restricted character movement and exploration , with varying degrees of success . Others , however , unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay , even embracing a somewhat parodic style .

In addition , it recommended a \" Council of State \" , an advisory body that would inform the Government of the effects its laws would have on minorities . This concept was based on the Kenyan Council of State which was established in 1958 during its phase of transition to African majority rule . The idea of an advisory body which could not significantly impede the legislative agenda was viewed by lawmakers as a promising innovation . In addition , the creation of an advisory council ensuring equal treatment in legislation was very much in line with the idea that , as citizens become increasingly aware of racial and religious issues , national growth will very much depend on an approach to such problems that is not fraught with religious and racial tensions ."

The discovery of hepatitis B virus and the invention of tests to detect it have radically changed many medical , and some cosmetic procedures . The screening of donated blood , which was introduced in the early 1970s , has dramatically reduced the transmission of the virus . Donations of human blood plasma and Factor VIII collected before 1975 often contained infectious levels of hepatitis B virus .

Even some fully furred species ( particularly sea lions ) are less haired than most land mammals . In species that live on ice , young pups have thicker coats than adults . The individual hairs on the coat , known collectively as lanugo , can trap heat from sunlight and keep the pup warm . Pinnipeds are typically countershaded , and are darker colored dorsally and lighter colored ventrally , which serves to eliminate shadows caused by light shining over the ocean water . The pure white fur of harp seal pups conceals them in their Arctic environment . Some species , such as ribbon seals , ringed seals and leopard seals , have patterns of contrasting light and dark coloration . All fully furred species molt ; phocids molt once a year , while otariids gradually molt all year . Seals have a layer of subcutaneous fat known as blubber that is particularly thick in phocids and walruses . Blubber serves both to keep the animals warm and to provide energy and nourishment when they are fasting . It can constitute as much as 50 % of a pinniped 's body weight . Pups are born with only a thin layer of blubber , but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos ."

Richard Dawkins describes the matter thus : \" The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view , yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [ on ] the other side of a deep valley , cutting unbridgeably across the massif of Mount Improbable . \" In such a fitness landscape , wheels might sit on a highly favorable \" peak \" , but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the gene pool to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection . Stephen Jay Gould notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components , commenting that \" wheels work well , but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy . \""

Forecasters at the NHC estimated maximum winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 981 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 97 inHg ) ; this made it a Category 1 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale and constituted the storm 's peak intensity . As Alex moved north toward the Azores , decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused it to weaken late on January 14 and into January 15 . The hurricane 's eyewall opened up and its convective structure decayed , indicating the start of its transition back into an extratropical cyclone . Becoming increasingly tilted with height due to shear , Alex weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall over Terceira Island at 13 : 15 UTC with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Hours later the system completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone , with its circulation becoming more elongated and the radius of maximum winds expanding significantly .

It was not until a few years after that they found mature fruit bodies , which revealed that the rosy color of the pore surface took some time to develop . They concluded that this and other differences in physical characteristics , as well as differences in spore size , were enough to justify it being a species distinct from B. felleus , so in 1941 they raised the taxon to species status with the name Boletus plumbeoviolaceus . Noted Agaricales taxonomist Rolf Singer later transferred the taxon to Tylopilus in 1947 , a genus characterized by a spore print that is pink , or wine red ( vinaceous ) , rather than brown as in Boletus ."

During his governorship he granted lands in the south to war veterans and to ranchers seeking alternative pasture lands during the drought . Although the south was regarded as a virtual desert at the time , it had great potential and resources for agricultural development , particularly for ranching operations . The government gave Rosas command of an army with orders to subdue the Indian tribes in the coveted territory . Rosas was generous to those Indians who surrendered , rewarding them with animals and goods . Although he personally disliked killing Indians , he relentlessly hunted down those who refused to yield . The Desert Campaign lasted from 1833 to 1834 , with Rosas subjugating the entire region .

One source gives the ancestors of the pony as Tibetan ponies brought into India over a thousand years ago , while another states their origins to be a cross between the Mongolian Wild Horse and the Arabian , brought to India by invading Tartar tribes , who also brought the equestrian game of polo . Manipuri ponies have been bred for centuries in the Manipur area of northeast India . The first written mention of the breed dates to a brief statement in the 1584 Manipur Royal Chronicle . By the early 1600s , the breed was mentioned frequently in Manipur literature . They were often used as cavalry horses , and were ridden by Meitei warriors . Manipuri ponies played a major part in the cavalry commanded by Garib Newaz , whose horsemen terrorized upper Burma throughout the early 1700s and in 1738 were used during his Sack of Sagaing . Between 1859 and 1916 , Manipuri ponies were extremely desired by the British for playing polo , and there were further infusions of Arabian blood in the 19th century , as British administrators and military officers sought to upgrade their polo ponies . The height of polo horses was initially restricted to 13 hands ( 52 inches , 132 cm ) , based on the average height of the Manipuri , and although this restriction was later relaxed to 14 hands ( 56 inches , 142 cm ) and then removed altogether , demand for Manipuris was so high that the area was drained of them . At one point during this period , the export of ponies from Manipur was banned to allow the breed time to increase in number to a viable level . Manipuris were also used to transport British troops into Burma throughout World War II ."

At the start of the conflict , Harlech 's garrison was badly equipped , and Conwy had fallen into disrepair . Conwy Castle was taken at the start of the conflict by two Welsh brothers , who took control of the fortress in a sneak attack , enabling Welsh rebels to attack and capture the rest of the walled town . Caernarfon was besieged in 1401 , and that November the Battle of Tuthill took place nearby between Caernarfon 's defenders and the besieging force . In 1403 and 1404 , Caernarfon was besieged again by Welsh troops with support from French forces , but withstood the attacks . Beaumaris fared less well . It was placed under siege and captured by the rebels in 1403 , only being retaken by royal forces in 1405 . Harlech was attacked and taken at the end of 1404 , becoming Glyndŵr 's military headquarters until English forces under the command of the future Henry V retook the castle in a siege over the winter of 1408 – 09 . By 1415 the uprising had been completely crushed , but the performance of the great castles and town walls is assessed by historian Michael Prestwich to have been \" no more than partially successful \" ."

The German cruiser Admiral Hipper encountered the convoy on 25 December , but little damage was inflicted by Admiral Hipper before she was driven off by the escorts . No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in Argus with bombs that they could not carry and their torpedoes were aboard Furious . After Furious 's Skuas had flown off to search for Hipper , space was made to land the Swordfish to load the torpedoes , but the Skuas could not locate Admiral Hipper because of the poor visibility . Furious reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941 and arrived back in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit . She made another ferry trip to Takoradi on 4 March , carrying 12 Fairey Fulmars of 807 Squadron and six Swordfish of 825 Squadron for self @-@ defence ."

Some time after 1018 and before 1054 , the kingdom appears to have been conquered by the Scots , most probably during the reign of Máel Coluim mac Cináeda who died in 1034 . At this time the territory of Strathclyde extended as far south as the River Derwent . In 1054 , the English king Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward of Northumbria against the Scots , then ruled by Mac Beth . By the 1070s , if not earlier in the reign of Máel Coluim mac Donnchada , it appears that the Scots again controlled Strathclyde , although William Rufus annexed the southern portion in 1092 . The territory was granted by Alexander I to his brother David , later King David I , in 1107 ."

    "text": "As a symbol , an urn cannot completely represent poetry , but it does serve as one component in describing the relationship between art and humanity . The nightingale of \" Ode to a Nightingale \" is separated from humanity and does not have human concerns . The urn , as a piece of art , requires an audience and is in an incomplete state on its own . This allows the urn to interact with humanity , to put forth a narrative , and allows for the imagination to operate . The images on the urn provoke the narrator to ask questions , and the silence of the urn reinforces the imagination 's ability to operate . This interaction and use of the imagination is part of a greater tradition called ut pictura poesis – the contemplation of art by a poet – which serves as a meditation upon art itself . In this meditation , the narrator dwells on the aesthetic and mimetic features of art . The beginning of the poem posits that the role of art is to describe a specific story about those with whom the audience is unfamiliar , and the narrator wishes to know the identity of the figures in a manner similar to \" Ode on Indolence \" and \" Ode to Psyche \" . The figures on the urn within \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" lack identities , but the first section ends with the narrator believing that if he knew the story , he would know their names . The second section of the poem , describing the piper and the lovers , meditates on the possibility that the role of art is not to describe specifics but universal characters , which falls under the term \" Truth \" . The three figures would represent how Love , Beauty , and Art are unified together in an idealised world where art represents the feelings of the audience . The audience is not supposed to question the events but instead to rejoice in the happy aspects of the scene in a manner that reverses the claims about art in \" Ode to a Nightingale \" . Similarly , the response of the narrator to the sacrifice is not compatible with the response of the narrator to the lovers ."

Chris Lomont developed a function to minimize approximation error by choosing the magic number R over a range . He first computed the optimal constant for the linear approximation step as 0x5f37642f , close to 0x5f3759df , but this new constant gave slightly less accuracy after one iteration of Newton 's method . Lomont then searched for a constant optimal even after one and two Newton iterations and found 0x5f375a86 , which is more accurate than the original at every iteration stage . He concluded by asking whether the exact value of the original constant was chosen through derivation or trial and error . Lomont pointed out that the magic number for 64 bit IEEE754 size type double is 0x5fe6ec85e7de30da , but it was later shown by Matthew Robertson to be exactly 0x5fe6eb50c7b537a9 . Charles McEniry performed a similar but more sophisticated optimization over likely values for R. His initial brute force search resulted in the same constant that Lomont determined . When he attempted to find the constant through weighted bisection , the specific value of R used in the function occurred , leading McEniry to believe that the constant may have originally been derived through \" bisecting to a given tolerance \" ."

Theories of Surplus Value is often referred to as the fourth volume book of Das Kapital and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the history of economic thought .

Here Marx elaborated his labour theory of value , which had been influenced by Thomas Hodgskin . Marx acknowledged Hodgskin 's \" admirable work \" Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital at more than one point in Capital . Indeed , Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production . No longer was there any \" natural reward of individual labour . Each labourer produces only some part of a whole , and each part having no value or utility of itself , there is nothing on which the labourer can seize , and say : ' This is my product , this will I keep to myself .

A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed , although Scott had ordered his team to do so , and at a distance of 150 miles from their base camp and 11 miles from the next depot , Scott and his companions died from a combination of exhaustion , starvation and extreme cold ."

    "text": "Snezhnevsky , the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences , developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria . A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non @-@ essential for the diagnosis , but symptoms of psychopathy , hypochondria , depersonalization or anxiety were central to it . Symptoms referred to as part of the \" negative axis \" included pessimism , poor social adaptation , and conflict with authorities , and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of \" sluggish schizophrenia with scanty symptoms . \" According to Snezhnevsky , patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as quasi sane yet manifest minimal but clinically relevant personality changes which could remain unnoticed to the untrained eye . Thereby patients with non @-@ psychotic mental disorders , or even persons who were not mentally sick , could be easily labelled with the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia . Along with paranoia , sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters . As per the theories of Snezhnevsky and his colleagues , schizophrenia was much more prevalent than previously considered since the illness could be presented with comparatively slight symptoms and only progress afterwards . As a consequence , schizophrenia was diagnosed much more often in Moscow than in cities of other countries , as the World Health Organization Pilot Study on Schizophrenia reported in 1973 . The city with the highest prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow . In particular , the scope was widened by sluggish schizophrenia because according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues , patients with this diagnosis were capable of functioning almost normally in the social sense . Their symptoms could be like those of a neurosis or could assume a paranoid character . The patients with paranoid symptoms retained some insight into their condition but overestimated their own significance and could manifest grandiose ideas of reforming society . Thereby , sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as \" reform delusions , \" \" perseverance , \" and \" struggle for the truth . \" As Viktor Styazhkin reported , Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reformation delusion for every case when a patient \" develops a new principle of human knowledge , drafts an academy of human happiness , and many other projects for the benefit of mankind . \""

The so @-@ called \" green consumer \" movements in the U.S. and other countries have struggled to reach critical mass and to remain in the forefront of shoppers ' minds . While public opinion polls taken since the late 1980s have shown consistently that a significant percentage of consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere profess a strong willingness to favor environmentally conscious products and companies , consumers ' efforts to do so in real life have remained sketchy at best . One of green marketing 's challenges is the lack of standards or public consensus about what constitutes \" green , \" according to Joel Makower , a writer on green marketing . In essence , there is no definition of \" how good is good enough \" when it comes to a product or company making green marketing claims . This lack of consensus — by consumers , marketers , activists , regulators , and influential people — has slowed the growth of green products , says Makower , because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes , and consumers are often skeptical about claims ."

Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient , centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia , and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the early Bronze Age .

As Peveril Castle was relatively unimportant , John decided not to maintain it and in 1374 gave orders to strip the lead from the buildings for re @-@ use at Pontefract Castle . It was inherited by his son Henry Bolingbroke , later King Henry IV , and remained under royal control , administered by the Duchy of Lancaster . During the 15th century , Peveril became less important as administrative functions were moved elsewhere . Although other castles administered by the Duchy of Lancaster were repaired in 1480 , there is no indication that this happened at Peveril . A survey conducted for the Duchy in 1561 revealed that Peveril was in a state of decay , and as a result , along with Donnington , was one of two castles that were subsequently abandoned . The castle however hosted local courts until 1600 . A survey in 1609 found that Peveril was \" very ruinous and serveth for no use \" . At some point in the post @-@ medieval period the keep 's facing stone was removed from three sides . The steep slope prevented the removal of the stone from the fourth side .

Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides , resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham . In 1796 , users of the navigation suggested that it should be extended to Weston Point , where the water was deeper . The trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls , but the users objected , and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties . Finally , the Trustees obtained a third Act on 8 August 1807 , which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point . The trustees insisted that their own engineer , John Johnson , should oversee the work , but the project was too large for him , and ran over time and budget . He was sacked in 1809 , after serving the navigation for 29 years , and Thomas Telford was asked to complete the work . He managed the project with Samuel Fowls as engineer . At Weston Point , a new lock connected the cut to a basin , and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey . This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810 . A fourth Act was obtained on 2 May 1825 , which altered some of the details of the previous Act , and an Act of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed . It stated that the Trustees had built a basin , piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point , that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver , and that the Trustees would make no additional charges for using the section . No tolls had been collected since 1816 , once the construction costs had been repaid ."

For example , every mammal @-@ based object in the game is given the property of having \" organic flesh \" , allowing it to be eaten or turned into meat , without having to specify these functions for each type of mammal they used . The Objectnaut approach allowed the team to create two distinct objects for words that may have similar meanings simply by adjusting each word 's properties in the database : \" lion \" , \" tiger \" and \" leopard \" while similar will behave differently and have different art assets , while the only difference in the game between \" croissant \" and \" danish \" is that the danish may be able to roll like a wheel .

He started as a subsizar — paying his way by performing valet 's duties — until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664 , which guaranteed him four more years until he would get his M.A. At that time , the college 's teachings were based on those of Aristotle , whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes , and astronomers such as Galileo and Thomas Street , through whom he learned of Kepler 's work . He set down in his notebook a series of ' Quaestiones ' about mechanical philosophy as he found it . In 1665 , he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus . Soon after Newton had obtained his B.A. degree in August 1665 , the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague .

Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast , Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron , which had split into two divisions . Although his divisions separated during the approach , Duckworth 's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line , targeting the flagship Impérial . Under pressure , the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship . Severely damaged and surrounded , Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture . The remaining French ship of the line , Diomède , followed him . Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore , British boarding parties captured both vessels and set them on fire . The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships , which Duckworth 's squadron had ignored ; they eventually returned to France ."

    "text": "The surplus of cents was relieved by the economic chaos engendered by the American Civil War , which began in 1861 . At the end of that year , the banks stopped paying out gold , which thereafter commanded a premium over paper money . These greenbacks , beginning in the following year , were issued in large quantities by the federal government . Silver vanished from commerce in June 1862 , as the price of that metal rose , leaving the cent the sole federal coin that had not entirely vanished from commerce through hoarding . The glut of cents had by then abated , as merchants had stored them away in quantity — one New York City floor collapsed beneath the load . There were other means of making change which passed in the emergency , from postage stamps to privately issued tokens , but the public demand was for the cent — the Philadelphia Mint struck record numbers , and set aside part of the production to be transmitted to other cities . Nevertheless , by July 1862 , the cent , in quantity , could only be purchased at a premium of 4 % in paper money in major cities in the East . The copper @-@ nickel pieces were nicknamed \" nickels \" , or \" nicks \" . Presentation of coins in payment carried with it no obligation to make change in the same . Accordingly , with a small quantity of \" nicks \" , a shopper could make purchases with exact change , without receiving such makeshifts as merchants ' credit slips , that others might not accept at the stated value ."

    "text": "Like other volcanic zones in the Garibaldi Belt , volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are . This is partly because the field is located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the past few hundred years . As a result , volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes , including tsunamis , earthquakes and landslides . However , with the existence of earthquakes , further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects , particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt is located in a highly populated area . Because of these concerns , significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of the Garibaldi volcanoes . This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism ."

Such acknowledgment has been made by the Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future and the Millennium Development Goals . There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues : according to the Brundtland report , “ poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems . It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality . ” Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs ( such as nutrition and medicine ) and general well @-@ being . As population growth continues to increase , increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials . According to the UN Population Fund , high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated , and the world ’ s poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates . The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment . For example , teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal , would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy , whereas using PET solar water disinfection would be . Also , sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials , such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country 's timber base . Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries , such as Bridges to Prosperity 's use of wire rope from shipping container gantry cranes to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa ."

He informed Le Sueur that the Malagasy on the ship had told him to find out whether the earlier landing party was there , but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that , if help was available on shore , he would signal back to the ship by waving a handkerchief above his head . Six Malagasy and another crew member also left the Meermin in a canoe , but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed . One Malagasy was shot dead and three others taken prisoner ; the dead Malagasy was later identified by one of the ship 's crew as the mutiny 's overall ringleader , but his name was not recorded . Of the remaining two , one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum back to the ship or drowned in the attempt . Enraged by the crew 's deception , the Malagasy still on the Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours , but the crew were able to defend themselves ."

An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1 @,@ 289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people . After several weeks , and up to eight months later , 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis . Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy . Lurman 's paper , now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study , proved that contaminated lymph was the source of the outbreak . Later , numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction , in 1909 , of hypodermic needles that were used , and , more importantly , reused , for administering Salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis . The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg , then working at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , discovered the Australia antigen ( later known to be hepatitis B surface antigen , or HBsAg ) in the blood of Australian aboriginal people . Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by MacCallum in 1947 , D.S. Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy . By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced , and the first vaccines were being tested ."

Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized : passive and active . Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal , and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area . Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting , and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture , and licking the other wolf 's face . When wolves are together , they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing , jaw wrestling , cheek rubbing and facial licking .

The leader of the captured group was a mining engineer , Hans Ott , who was also an officer of the Abwehr , the Wehrmacht 's intelligence organisation . The captured group had been identifying new sources of metal and timber for the Germans , but Ott had also been tasked by the Abwehr with making contact with the Partisans . Following their capture , Ott told his captors that he had an important message to deliver to Partisan headquarters , and after he had been taken there he suggested to the Partisans that his group be exchanged for Partisans held by the Germans in jails in Zagreb . On that basis , Ott was sent to Zagreb on parole , where he met with the German Plenipotentiary General in Croatia , General der Infanterie ( Lieutenant General ) Edmund Glaise @-@ Horstenau . He advised Glaise @-@ Horstenau that Tito was willing to exchange the eight Germans for ten Partisans that were held by the Germans , Italians and NDH authorities . Glaise @-@ Horstenau contacted the commander of the Italian 2nd Army , Generale designato d ’ Armata ( acting General ) Mario Roatta , who had most of the identified Partisan prisoners in his custody . On 14 August , the German ambassador to the NDH , SA @-@ Obergruppenführer ( Lieutenant General ) Siegfried Kasche sent a telegram to the Reich Foreign Ministry advising of the proposed exchange and asked the Ministry to intercede with the Italians . In his book Tito , Mihailović , and the Allies , 1941 – 1945 , published in 1973 , the former US diplomat Walter Roberts argued that the Abwehr considered some sort of modus vivendi with the Partisans might be possible , and were thinking of more than prisoner exchanges when they gave Ott the task of making contact with the Partisans . The number of Germans in Partisan custody had been increasing , and this made some sort of prisoner swap agreement more likely . These agreements were initially led by Marijan Stilinović on behalf of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters . On 5 September , a prisoner swap was completed in an area between Duvno and Livno , where 38 Partisans and family members were exchanged for one senior German officer who had been captured during the Battle of Livno in December 1942 ."

Without sufficient funds to build another fleet , the Athenians could only wait as Lysander sailed westward across the Aegean towards their city . Blockaded by land and sea , with their food supplies running low , the Athenians sent ambassadors to the Spartan king Agis , whose army was camped outside their walls , offering to join the Spartan alliance if they were allowed to keep their walls and port ; Agis , claiming that he had no power to negotiate , sent the ambassadors on to Sparta , but there they were told that , if they really wanted peace , they should bring the Spartans better proposals . The Athenians were initially intransigent , going so far as to imprison a man who suggested that a stretch of the long walls be torn down as the Spartans had insisted , but the reality of their situation soon compelled them to consider compromises . In this situation , Theramenes , in a speech to the assembly , requested that he be sent as an ambassador to Lysander ( who was at this time besieging Samos ) to determine the Spartans ' intentions towards Athens ; he also stated that he had discovered something that might improve the Athenians ' situation , although he declined to share it with the citizenry . His request was granted , and Theramenes sailed to Samos to meet with Lysander ; from there , he was sent to Sparta , perhaps stopping at Athens on the way . At Sparta , with representatives of all of Sparta 's allies present , Theramenes and his colleagues negotiated the terms of the peace that ended the Peloponnesian War ; the long walls and the walls of Piraeus were pulled down , the size of the Athenian fleet was sharply limited , and Athenian foreign policy was subordinated to that of Sparta ; the treaty also stipulated that the Athenians were to use \" the constitution of their ancestors \" .

It appears to act as a tumor suppressor and is expressed strongly in the skin , distal nephrons , and type I pneumocytes . It has also been found in the parotid gland , brain , breast , pancreas , prostate , and ovaries . Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way . Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division , leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors . Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism , possibly through modulation of the mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) pathway and / or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria .

This spurred development of the city port and its transport connections , including construction of a new breakwater and the Split – Knin railway . In 1925 , the railway was linked to the Rijeka – Zagreb railway via Gospić , allowing development of a modern port . Since 1957 , cargo terminals of the Port of Split were relocated from the city centre to industrial zones in Solin and Kaštela areas , while passenger traffic still uses the centrally positioned harbor ."

However , the makers said that \" kaminey \" is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment . According to Bhardwaj , the idea for the title came from a scene from Gulzar 's Ijaazat ( 1987 ) , in which the lead actor ( Naseeruddin Shah ) refers to the actress in a loving manner ; it was the first time that he heard the word used that way . Bhardwaj told Rediff , \" when the script of this film was written , it was like discovering your own mean side . The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film , excluding one , has an agenda . So I thought it was an apt title for the film \" ."

A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces , one pointing north , and one pointing east . Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force . Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions . This is because , for orthogonal components , the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors . Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other . Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient . Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable , since that force would then have only one non @-@ zero component . Orthogonal force vectors can be three @-@ dimensional with the third component being at right @-@ angles to the other two ."

Collections grew in size with increasing maritime activity , exploration and colonialism . For example , Charles Darwin collected over 400 bird specimens during his travels on the Beagle , and it was many years after his return to England that his bird collections from the Galapagos inspired ( in part ) his theory of evolution through natural selection . The Paris museum had 463 bird specimens in 1793 and this grew to 3411 in 1809 ; The Berlin museum had 2000 specimens in 1813 growing to 13 @,@ 760 around 1850 . In 1753 there were 1172 bird specimens in the museum established by Sir Hans Sloane but these appear to have perished before they moved to the British Museum . Early specimens from Captan Cook 's voyages as well as those described by Latham in his General Synopsis of Birds ( 1781 – 1785 ) were also lost possibly due to poor preservation technique . The scale of collections grew to the point where they needed more space and full @-@ time curators . In the earliest days of ornithology , collecting was the dominant method of bird observation and study . This approach has diminished with the growth of the discipline . The use of mist @-@ netting and photography , blood sampling ( for DNA , immunological and other studies ) , the development of optics and the use of other new techniques for studying birds have reduced the need to collect specimens for research , yet collections continue to act as a vital shared resource for science ( particularly taxonomy ) and conservation . In an era of mass extinction , bird collections will evidence lost species ."

It was found though that alloys aged poorly and could encourage the development of a matrix of oxides on the water surface of the plug , this matrix having a dangerously high melting point that made the plug inoperable . In 1888 the US Steamboat Inspection Service made a requirement that plugs were to be made of pure banca tin and replaced annually . This avoided lead and also zinc contamination . Zinc contamination was regarded as so serious a problem that the case of the plugs was also changed from brass ( a copper @-@ zinc alloy ) to a zinc @-@ free copper @-@ tin bronze , to avoid the risk of zinc migrating from the housing into the alloy plug ."

During the Church of Scientology 's battle with the IRS , Moxon 's law firm hired private investigators to investigate the government agency . Private investigator Michael L. Shomers said he set up a dummy operation called \" Washington News Bureau \" , posed as a reporter , and attempted to collection material on Scientology critics . Shomers also said he infiltrated IRS conferences in attempts to collect data on IRS employees that may have been skipping appointments , drinking or having affairs . Shomers said he was either paid in cash or by checks from Moxon 's firm Bowles & Moxon . According to The New York Times , Moxon said Shomers ' activities were legal , and that he and other Scientology attorneys used private investigators to counter falsehoods from \" rogue government agents \" ."

Spruance judged that the need to throw something at the enemy as soon as possible was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds ( fighters , bombers , and torpedo bombers ) . Accordingly , American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups . It was accepted that the lack of coordination would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties , but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile , since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike ( Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks ) , and he gambled that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable ."

This attitude has led to the belief that the guerrilla and subversive groups that operate in Colombia have clandestine operatives inside the university , a belief that has been supported by the discovery of unconventional weaponry inside the university grounds . This has resulted in the targeting of student activists by criminal and paramilitary groups . On October 4 , 2006 , a student of Technology of Prehospital Attention and representative at the Academic Council , Julian Andrés Hurtado , was killed by hitmen . In his honor , the Government of Valle del Cauca and the Institute for the Development of Valle del Cauca ( Spanish : Instituto Financiero para el Desarrollo del Valle del Cauca , INFIVALLE ) established a scholarship program that bears his name . Another situation that reflects the stigmatization of the student body is the unfounded arrests of students during the disturbances , such as those that occurred on April 3 , 2008 , when four students were captured without substantial evidence , and eventually released when it was demonstrated that they were not even near the confrontation site at the time of the disturbances ."

This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics , since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink . The radiation , however also carries away entropy , and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in Planck units is in fact always increasing . This allows the formulation of the first law of black hole mechanics as an analogue of the first law of thermodynamics , with the mass acting as energy , the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy ."

Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \" mob football \" played in England . The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century , when intramural games of football began to be played on college campuses . Each school played its own variety of football . Princeton University students played a game called \" ballown \" as early as 1820 . A Harvard tradition known as \" Bloody Monday \" began in 1827 , which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes . In 1860 , both the town police and the college authorities agreed the Bloody Monday had to go . The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \" Football Fightum \" , for whom they conducted funeral rites . The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard . Dartmouth played its own version called \" Old division football \" , the rules of which were first published in 1871 , though the game dates to at least the 1830s . All of these games , and others , shared certain commonalities . They remained largely \" mob \" style games , with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area , often by any means necessary . Rules were simple , violence and injury were common . The violence of these mob @-@ style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them . Yale , under pressure from the city of New Haven , banned the play of all forms of football in 1860 ."

The mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia , and has a religious significance in these cultures .

This led to the appointment of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel to oversee the construction of enhanced fortifications along the Atlantic Wall , with special emphasis on the most likely invasion front , which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg . Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion , so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore . In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast , he ordered wooden stakes , metal tripods , mines , and large anti @-@ tank obstacles to be placed on the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks . Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach , he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high @-@ tide mark . The terrain at Utah is flat , offering no high ground on which to place fortifications . The shallow beach varies in depth from almost nothing to 800 yards ( 730 m ) , depending on the tides .

As the demand for yoga classes grows , many people get certified to become yoga instructors , often with relatively little training . Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries . In turn , a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them ."

Jacob More , having trained with the Nories , moved to Italy in 1773 and is chiefly known as a landscape painter . This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general , from viewing them as hostile , empty regions occupied by backwards and marginal people , to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature , occupied by rugged primitives , which were now depicted in a dramatic fashion . Produced before his departure to Italy , More 's series of four \" Falls of Clyde \" ( 1771 – 73 ) paintings have been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as treating the waterfalls as \" a kind of natural national monument \" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape ."
