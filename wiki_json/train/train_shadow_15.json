A cultivated and wealthy man , Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718 . It is likely he met both Burlington — the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England — and William Kent in Italy in 1715 , and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived . Coke returned to England , not only with a newly acquired library , but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion . However , after his return , he lived a feckless life , preoccupying himself with drinking , gambling and hunting , and being a leading supporter of cockfighting . He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720 , the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke 's planned new country estate for over ten years . Coke , who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744 , died in 1759 — five years before the completion of Holkham — having never fully recovered his financial losses . Thomas 's wife , Lady Margaret Tufton , Countess of Leicester ( 1700 – 1775 ) , would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house ."

    "text": "The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated . A molecular phylogeny based on rDNA analysis dating from 2005 suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe @-@ finned fishes .

Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the temnospondyl @-@ origin hypothesis is more credible than other theories . The neobatrachians seemed to have originated in Africa / India , the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea . Other researchers , while agreeing with the main thrust of this study , questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data . They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the Permian , rather less than 300 million years ago , a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data . A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological , as well as molecular data , came to the conclusion that Lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within Lepospondyli rather than within Temnospondyli . The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late Carboniferous , some 290 to 305 million years ago . The split between Anura and Caudata was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago , rather later than most molecular studies suggest , with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago ."

The relative success of Community Transit in the late 1970s and 1980s prompted the Community Transit Board to propose consolidation with Everett Transit in 1988 , though long @-@ term planning under SNOTRAN for both agencies worked under the assumption that there would be no merger by 2000 . In 1990 , a second proposal was rejected by the Everett City Council after consultants determined that a merger would only save $ 350 @,@ 000 per year in deadheading for Community Transit and that both staffs would need to be retained because of the lack of service duplication between the two agencies .

State voters approved Referendum 49 in November 1998 , including state motor @-@ vehicle excise tax revenue for city @-@ run transit in Everett and Yakima . While Everett Transit gained $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 6 @.@ 53 million in 2016 ) in new annual funding , CT was set to lose $ 1 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 45 million in 2016 ) over the next five years in addition to the $ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 2 @.@ 9 million in 2016 ) used to operate service within Everett annually .

The theatre has a Corinthian colonnade at the first floor , rising to the second , forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer . This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances . The theatre lies on an east – west axis . The stage at the western end was 49 feet ( 14 @.@ 9 m ) deep and 69 @.@ 5 feet ( 21 @.@ 2 m ) wide , and reputedly the first to be flat , rather than raked .

After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka , a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club , the next day .

    "text": "Oryzomys antillarum probably became extinct about the 1870s and is currently listed as such by the IUCN Red List . Its disappearance is usually attributed to the small Asian mongoose ( Herpestes javanicus ) , which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872 , and sometimes also to introduced Rattus species . Ray , on the other hand , argued that the significance of the mongoose had been overrated . Instead , he suggested that Oryzomys antillarum may have been affected by the massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655 . In that period , the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation , so that the native habitat of Oryzomys was destroyed . Thus , Oryzomys was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man @-@ made habitats , to which the latter are well adapted . Perhaps , Ray wrote , the black rat may not have been able to extirpate Oryzomys , but the brown rat , a later and more assertive invader , brought it to extinction . Cats and dogs preying on Oryzomys may also have contributed to its demise ."

It is likely that clinical improvement of his patients during the Dutch famine of 1944 ( during which flour was scarce ) may have contributed to his discovery . Dicke noticed that the shortage of bread led to a significant drop in the death rate among children affected by coeliac disease from greater than 35 % to essentially zero . He also reported that once wheat was again available after the conflict , the mortality rate soared to previous levels . The link with the gluten component of wheat was made in 1952 by a team from Birmingham , England . Villous atrophy was described by British physician John W.

    "text": "Surface currents only affect the top few hundred meters ( yards ) of the sea , but there are also large @-@ scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses . A main deep ocean current flows through all the world 's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt . This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature . At high latitudes , the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out . Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks . From the deep sea near Greenland , such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the Atlantic . When it reaches the Antarctic , it is joined by further masses of cold , sinking water and flows eastwards . It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans . Here it is gradually warmed , becomes less dense , rises towards the surface , and loops back on itself . Some flows back into the Atlantic . It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed ."

In December 1938 , NACA asked for $ 11 million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in Sunnyvale , California , to supplement the existing Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory .

However , Congress was not convinced of its value , and Bush had to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 5 , 1939 . It was a frustrating experience for Bush , since he had never appeared before Congress before , and the senators were not swayed by his arguments .

For a long time , Madonna had desired to play Eva and even wrote a letter to director Alan Parker , explaining how she would be perfect for the part . After securing the role , she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Layder since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts . Layder noted that the singer \" had to use her voice in a way she 's never used it before . Evita is real musical theater — its operatic , in a sense . Madonna developed an upper register that she didn 't know she had . \" From the moment she was signed in the film , Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of \" Don 't Cry for Me Argentina \" .

However , the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head . At the 2nd Regional Congress ( held in March 1965 ) , it was decided to endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state , and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister , the cabinet , the chief of staff , and the top military commanders . This change curtailed the powers of the National Command , who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs . In response , at the 8th National Congress ( April 1965 ) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists , but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member , Jibran Majdalani , and a Saudi member , Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party 's civilian leadership , as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch .

Its chief means of defence lies in the foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin . This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it . Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs , rats and mink , and even domestic cats . Birds that feed on toads include herons , crows and birds of prey . Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal 's liver , thus avoiding the toxin . The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt .

    "text": "The motives of the nobility are somewhat clearer than those of the peasants ; greed was apparently not a major factor . It is commonly assumed , for example by Runciman as mentioned above , that only younger members of a family went on crusade , looking for wealth and adventure elsewhere , as they had no prospects for advancement at home . Riley @-@ Smith has shown that this was not always the case . The crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France , who left everything behind , and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense . For example , Robert of Normandy loaned the Duchy of Normandy to his brother William II of England , and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church . According to Tancred 's biographer , he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare , and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence . Tancred and Bohemond , as well as Godfrey , Baldwin , and their older brother Eustace III , Count of Boulogne , are examples of families who crusaded together . Riley @-@ Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations , as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives . Nevertheless , in at least some cases , personal advancement played a role in Crusaders ' motives . For instance , Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east , and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this . The Crusade gave him a further opportunity , which he took after the Siege of Antioch , taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch ."

Caroline once complained to Leopold that the evening express train back to Brussels gave her little time to shop , causing Leopold to arrange it so that the train would leave an hour later . When pregnant with their first child , the king and the French government even split the cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable . Taking Caroline with him everywhere , the king spent much of his time outside Belgium on his various properties throughout Western Europe , and was much resented by the Belgian people as a result . Much of this time was spent with Caroline and their two sons at his estate at Cap Ferrat in southern France . Caroline also stayed at Chateau de Larmoy , which Leopold had rented for her ; he acquired the French Chateau de Balaincourt as well as a villa in Brussels , where Caroline had no scruples in appearing in public . Though typically traveling incognito , she accompanied Leopold to the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901 , causing a great scandal . Her unpopularity in Belgium increased dramatically once it began to be realized that all of Leopold 's riches from the Congo were not benefiting his country , but rather himself and his young mistress ."

In adults , single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg / kg of bodyweight , whichever is lower , have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity . Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels . Following a normal dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks , patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value . It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure . Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days . In adults , a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity , while in children acute doses above 200 mg / kg could potentially cause toxicity . Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death , and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment , with chronic larger @-@ than @-@ normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children .

Expansion was rapid , and they received commissions for Christ 's Hospital school near Horsham , the King Edward VII sanatorium in Midhurst , Graylingwell Hospital in Chichester , the choir stalls in Westminster Abbey and almost every railway station owned by the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway . Longley and Sons , which soon became Longley and Company , quickly became one of southeast England 's main building firms ; but it was nearly ruined on 20 March 1924 when the joinery and timber works , all stock inside it and sixty machines were destroyed by fire . The firm recovered , though , and was able to tender for a wide range of contracts in the New Town era , including Hazelwick School , much of the Manor Royal industrial estate , Crawley fire station , the Queen 's Square shopping area and Crawley College 's tower block extension ."

In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity , pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas . He has argued that the sonatas complement each other in their different characters , and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs . Moreover , each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements , and passages from one movement often reappear , usually transformed , in later movements . Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening . In some cases , however , Schubert quotes a theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration , inserting it in structurally significant locations , creating an immediately audible allusion .

When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped Pegler stepped in and bought it outright , with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson . He spent large amounts of money over the next few years having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition : the smoke deflectors were removed ; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney ; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936 . It was also repainted in LNER livery . Pegler then persuaded the British Railways Board to let him run enthusiasts ' specials ; it was at the time the only steam locomotive running on mainline British Railways . It worked a number of rail tours , including a non @-@ stop London to Edinburgh run in 1968 , the year steam traction officially ended on BR .

In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward , but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues , it was a hopeless mission . In the end , Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward , not unsurprising given Peckham 's views of the Welsh . Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses as part of his tour of all his subordinate dioceses . While there , Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives , conspicuous consumption , and heavy drinking .

    "text": "Conversely , Andrew Harding has argued that the idea of substantive natural justice is vague and subjective , and has taken the view that fundamental rules of natural justice are entirely procedural in nature . In his opinion , Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Constitution is designed to prevent substantively discriminatory legislation . To determine whether legislation is discriminatory , a rational nexus test is applied . It would be strange if legislation that passed this test could nonetheless be struck down due to inconsistency with natural justice . Therefore , the extension of Article 12 ( 1 ) to include natural justice shows that the Privy Council in Ong Ah Chuan could not have intended to apply natural justice in a substantive sense . Further support for this argument can be found in the Privy Council 's decision Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor ( 1981 ) which discussed fundamental rules of natural justice in a procedural context , their Lordships stating that they had to consider \" whether the consequence of the alteration [ of certain statutory provisions ] is a procedure for the trial of criminal offences that is contrary to some fundamental rule of natural justice \" . The substantive review of legislation by the court was also rejected in Jabar bin Kadermastan v. Public Prosecutor ( 1995 ) , the Court of Appeal holding that \" any law which provides for the deprivation of a person 's life or personal liberty , is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament . The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair , just and reasonable as well . \" Subsequently , in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney @-@ General ( 2011 ) , the Court held that fundamental rules of natural justice and the principles of natural justice in administrative law \" are the same in nature and function , except that they operate at different levels of our legal order , one to invalidate legislation on the ground of unconstitutionality , and the other to invalidate administrative decisions on the ground of administrative law principles \" ."

There is some evidence that speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation , although studies are scarce and of low quality . Regular physical exercise with or without physiotherapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility , flexibility , strength , gait speed , and quality of life . When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist , there are more improvements in motor symptoms , mental and emotional functions , daily living activities , and quality of life compared to a self @-@ supervised exercise program at home . In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity , generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension . Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk , rhythmic initiation , diaphragmatic breathing , and meditation techniques . As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia ( slowness of movement ) , shuffling and decreased arm swing ; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety . Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on but are not limited to improving gait speed , the base of support , stride length , trunk and arm swing movement . Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment ( pole walking and treadmill walking ) , verbal cueing ( manual , visual and auditory ) , exercises ( marching and PNF patterns ) and altering environments ( surfaces , inputs , open vs. closed ) . Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson 's disease .

These change only over periods of millions of years due to processes such as plate tectonics . Other climate determinants are more dynamic : the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5 ° C ( 9 ° F ) warming of the northern Atlantic Ocean compared to other ocean basins . Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale . The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption , water retention , and rainfall on a regional level . Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet , leading to global warming or global cooling .

The Johor Agreement was irrelevant – as the Colonial Secretary was a representative of the United Kingdom government which was not a foreign state in relation to Johor at the time , there was no question of the United Kingdom having to consent to Johor issuing the reply .

Starting on 10 June 1948 , England and Australia played five Tests . Australia had not lost a Test since the Second World War and were strong favourites . Their captain Don Bradman had publicly expressed his ambition of going through the tour without defeat , and Australia won 10 of their 12 lead @-@ up matches , eight by an innings . The England team , however , had several notable players themselves , including Len Hutton , Denis Compton and Alec Bedser .

The Australians remained undefeated for their entire tour of England , earning them the sobriquet of The Invincibles ."

Defense works were established to the east of the Yanmen Pass , with a line of fortifications and beacon fires stretching from Pingcheng County ( present @-@ day Datong ) through the valley of the Sanggan River to Dai County , Shanxi . By 38 AD , as a result of raids by the Xiongnu further to the west against the Wei River valley , orders were given for a series of walls to be constructed as defences for the Fen River , the southward course of the Yellow River , and the region of the former imperial capital , Chang 'an . These constructions were defensive in nature , which marked a shift from the offensive walls of the preceding Emperor Wu and the rulers of the Warring States . By the early 40s AD the northern frontiers of China had undergone drastic change : the line of the imperial frontier followed not the advanced positions conquered by Emperor Wu but the rear defences indicated roughly by the modern ( Ming dynasty ) Great Wall . The Ordos region , northern Shanxi , and the upper Luan River basin around Chengde were abandoned and left to the control of the Xiongnu . The rest of the frontier remained somewhat intact until the end of the Han dynasty , with the Dunhuang manuscripts ( discovered in 1900 ) indicating that the military establishment in the northwest was maintained for most of the Eastern Han period ."

As early as the 1930s , various Saskatchewan cities , towns , and rural municipalities lobbied the provincial government to develop hard surfaced roads , including Highway 11 , to connect its major centers , particularly Regina , Saskatoon , Prince Albert and Moose Jaw . Saskatoon mayor R.M. Pinder argued that Highway 11 should receive priority because \" it serves the greatest number of people for the longest period of time \" and its hard surfacing would facilitate the travel of American tourists to Prince Albert National Park and support transport operations to and from the Dundurn Military Camp . A dispute flared up between Saskatoon and Prince Albert community organizations over whether Highway 11 or Highway 2 should be paved first . Prince Albert advocated prioritizing Highway 2 as a more direct route between the northern and southern parts of the province and a more attractive route for American tourists driving to Prince Albert National Park . Saskatoon preferred Highway 11 because the alternative would bypass it and not provide as many Saskatchewan residents the transportation benefits of direct access to a paved highway . In 1950 , the provincial government indicated that it would prioritize the paving of Highway 11 between Saskatoon and Regina ; by October 1952 this section was completely paved . The improved highway was also rerouted in some places , including the section between Bladworth and Dundurn which was completely rebuilt , and bypasses were built around some towns and villages through which it had formerly passed . Although the highway 's route had not entirely reached its present contours , it was made straighter ; the distance traversed between Saskatoon and Regina was reduced by 27 miles . It more closely followed the CNR tracks and contained fewer right angle corners than it had in 1926 . The highway between Saskatoon and Prince Albert received less attention during this period ; a 1956 highway map shows that it was still almost entirely gravel ."

Fearful of royalists , “ it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse . They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick [ sic ] burial ... and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands , it was resolved to wrap it up in lead , to put it aboard a Barge , and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames , which was done the night following Cromwell 's death . ” In 1664 , Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “ Cromwell did , in his life , transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another , and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now set upon a post be that of Cromwell , or one of the Kings ” . If this story had any accuracy , Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself . Another story even suggested that Cromwell 's body was substituted for Charles I , adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “ an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649 ” .

A study of nine species , mostly marsupials of a similar size , showed that devils were more difficult for drivers to detect and thus avoid . At high beam , devils had the lowest detection distance , 40 % closer than the median . This requires a 20 % reduction in speed for a motorist to avoid the devil . For low beam , the devils are the seventh worst in terms of detection distance , 16 % below the median . For avoidance of roadkill to be feasible , motorists would have to drive at around half the current speed limit in rural areas . A study in the 1990s on a localised population of devils in a national park in Tasmania recorded a halving of the population after a hitherto gravel access road was upgraded , surfaced with bitumen and widened . At the same time , there was a large increase in deaths caused by vehicles along the new road ; there had been none in the preceding six months . The vast majority of deaths occurred in the sealed portion of the road , believed to be due to an increase in speeds . It was also conjectured that the animals were harder to see against the dark bitumen instead of the light gravel . The devil and quoll are especially vulnerable as they often try to retrieve roadkill for food and travel along the road . To alleviate the problem , traffic slowing measures , man @-@ made pathways that offer alternative routes for devils , education campaigns , and the installation of light reflectors to indicate oncoming vehicles have been implemented . They are credited with decreases in roadkill . Devils have often been victims of roadkill when they are retrieving other roadkill . Work by scientist Menna Jones and a group of conservation volunteers to remove dead animals from the road resulted in a significant reduction in devil traffic deaths . It was estimated that 3 @,@ 392 devils , or between 3 @.@ 8 and 5 @.@ 7 % of the population , were being killed annually by vehicles in 2001 – 04 .

On 25 September 2015 , 20 immunised devils were microchipped and released in Narawntapu National Park .

For Europe as a whole , 1500 is often considered to be the end of the Middle Ages , but there is no universally agreed upon end date . Depending on the context , events such as Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to the Americas in 1492 , the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453 , or the Protestant Reformation in 1517 are sometimes used . English historians often use the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 to mark the end of the period . For Spain , dates commonly used are the death of King Ferdinand II in 1516 , the death of Queen Isabella I of Castile in 1504 , or the conquest of Granada in 1492 . Historians from Romance @-@ speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts : an earlier \" High \" and later \" Low \" period .

Along with other female writers , such as Mary Hays , Helen Maria Williams , Charlotte Turner Smith , Mary Robinson , Maria Edgeworth , and Hannah More , Wollstonecraft felt compelled to respond to the Rousseauvean ideological aesthetic that had come to dominate British fiction . Romantic heroines , Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes , \" represent woman constructed for man : the heroic feminine victim of the courtly rake and gallant , the virtuous feminine companion of the ideal professionalized gentleman , and the intellectually and erotically subservient companion of the ideal bourgeois man \" . Wollstonecraft would also attack Rousseau in her best @-@ known work , A Vindication of the Rights of Woman , because of his sexism in the second part of Emile . She announces in the \" Advertisement \" ( a section similar to a preface ) of Mary that she is offering her heroine , who is a \" genius \" , as a contrast to characters such as Samuel Richardson 's Clarissa and Rousseau 's Sophie . In addition the text is peppered with allusions to popular sentimental novels such as The History of Eliza Warwick ( 1778 ) and The Platonic Marriage ( 1787 ) , which critique their presentation of the heroine of feminine sensibility . Mary is more akin to the charitable and industrious heroines of Bluestocking Sarah Scott 's Millenium Hall ( 1762 ) than to the passive , weepy heroines found in most sentimental novels . Debate concerning the relationship between gender and sensibility continued into the early 19th century ; Jane Austen , for example , made it the explicit focus of her novel Sense and Sensibility ( 1811 ) ."

The manor of Flixton 's boundaries are unclear , although they were perhaps formed by a mixture of natural and man @-@ made features including Carr Ditch , which divided Flixton and Urmston . St Michael 's Church is also first recorded at about the same time , although the building may date from an earlier period . In keeping with a pattern found in northern and eastern Cheshire and south @-@ eastern Lancashire , the parish comprised isolated farmsteads and a medieval manor house , rather than a village centre . Notable place names in medieval Flixton include Shaw Hall , located near the present @-@ day Roebuck Hotel , east of the modern Flixton village . The location of Berne is unknown , while Booths was possibly somewhere near Hulme Bridge Farm , close to the Irwell . An area named Wood may have existed in the north @-@ western part of Flixton , near a Woods @-@ end Farm noted in an 1818 survey . A Shaw Hall , whose name first appears in 1508 and was derived from a small wood , was described by historian Michael Nevell as \" the most significant medieval estate within the township \" . Reputed to be a Jacobean era mansion , it was referred to as a manor in 1594 , although whether this was also the case during the medieval period is unknown . It was the home of the Valentines , the Asshawes and the Egertons , and during the English Civil War was defended against a potential attack by Royalist forces . The Egertons remained at Shaw Hall until 1757 ; thereafter it was occupied by various families , until it was demolished in the 20th century ."

One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not . Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed . Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant , and are responsible , for example , for the differences between anthers , petals and normal leaves , despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code . Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell 's life . Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable , while others are reset in the germ cells ."

Parrots were hunted , kept as pets , and traded by Amerindians in the Caribbean before the arrival of Europeans . The Cuban macaw was reportedly \" stupid \" and slow to escape , and therefore was easily caught . It was killed for food ; Gemelli Careri found the meat tasty , but Gundlach considered it tough . Archaeological evidence suggests the Cuban macaw was hunted in Havana in the 16th – 18th centuries . It may also have been persecuted as a crop pest , though it did not live near dwellings ."

The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased . The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave ."

The most positive thing he said of the episode was that \" Spiner 's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he 's onscreen as Lore \" . DeCandido gave \" Datalore \" a score of four out of ten . Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007 . While he credited the art direction of the episode , he criticised the story , saying that \" it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they 're supposed to happen , rather than having them happen organically . The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical , the audience isn 't surprised by anything after the second act , and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft . \" He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child , but felt that it didn 't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult , and stated that Spiner 's \" fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore \" wasn 't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode . He gave it a D grade ."

A required element is intent , or mens rea . In R v Pearman , the Court of Appeal of England and Wales confirmed that the definition of intent in the 1981 Act is the same as the definition in the common law . The common law gives intention \" its normal meaning : purpose or aim \" , with judges advised not to , in the majority of cases , attempt to complicate the definition . Conditional intent – where somebody has an intent to commit a crime only in certain circumstances – has also been deemed acceptable for an indictment for attempting a crime . In Attorney @-@ General 's Reference ( Nos. 1 and 2 of 1979 ) , the Court of Appeal explained that the intention to steal \" anything that was worth stealing could form the basis of an attempt charge if the indictment was drafted carefully \" .

Darwin 's study in his original house survives at Beacon St , Lichfield WS13 7AD , http : / / www.erasmusdarwin.org / and is recognisable as the site of the painting . The eight paned window is unchanged ; the door position remains as depicted in the painting , though the architrave is missing . A full moon can be seen from this room at the same bearing and inclination as in the painting , just after midnight when the moon is full . Darwin 's \" philosophical feasts \" that started with the afternoon meal often carried on throughout the night . Wright met Darwin in the early 1760s , probably through their common connection of John Whitehurst , first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when he stayed in the Darwin household for a week . The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary ( Polly ) Darwin impressed Wright . In the 1980s Eric Evans ( National Gallery ) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch . As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin 's flamboyant character , it is more likely that this is Dr William Small . The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small 's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle . Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765 , consistent with this being a meeting in 1767 . The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle ."

As with all tower defense games , the player must defend their home base by building several types of static tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent . In Defenders of Ardania , however , players must also spawn soldiers themselves . Like the opponent 's soldiers , the player 's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent 's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player . The game is won if units spawned by the player get past the opponent 's towers and destroy the opponent 's base before the opponent 's units get past the player 's towers and destroy the player 's base ."

Some authorities suggest that it is the result from overvigorous fluid replacement , but the complication may develop before treatment has been commenced . It is more likely in those with more severe DKA , and in the first episode of DKA . Likely factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration , acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels ; in addition , the increased level of inflammation and coagulation may , together with these factors , lead to decreased blood flow to parts of the brain , which then swells up once fluid replacement has been commenced . The swelling of brain tissue leads to raised intracranial pressure ultimately leading to death ."

Although records indicate there was a play called Pocahontas ; or the Indian Princess , credited as being adapted by T.A. Cooper , that played The Theatre Royal at Drury Lane in London on December 15 , 1820 , and subsequently on December 16 and December 19 , the piece differed drastically from Barker 's original and featured a completely different cast of characters . Barker himself wrote that the production was done without his permission or even his knowledge , and based on a critical response he read of the London performance , he deduced that there was very little in the play that was his own . Other evidence suggests that the script used in England was not only a completely different play , but that it was likely not even originated by an American . This assertion is based primarily on three factors : the kinder and meeker portrayal of the Natives , which reduces the grandeur of the play 's American heroes , the more vague listing of the setting as \" North America \" rather than specifically \" Virginia , \" and the lack of implications about America 's great destiny that was evident in Barker 's version . The distinction between the London and American versions is also supported by a review of the London production , in which the reviewer cites a lack of comic characters ( Barker ’ s version included several ) , and the presence of a character named “ Opechancaough , ” who is nowhere to be found in Barker ’ s play ."

The fifteenth tropical cyclone , tenth named storm , and third hurricane of the season , Josephine developed from an area of disturbed weather near the Bahamas on October 7 , forming with subtropical characteristics . It quickly organized , and gained tropical characteristics as it strengthened into a tropical storm on October 8 . Gradual intensification occurred thereafter , reaching hurricane status on October 10 . The storm headed northward , remaining well offshore of the eastern United States . Josephine strengthened further and peaked as a moderately strong Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale on October 12 . On the following day , Josephine weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary . It later headed northeastward and paralleled the coast well offshore of Nova Scotia . By October 17 , Josephine weakened back to a tropical storm , shortly before beginning to execute a cyclonic loop to the south of Newfoundland . While executing the cyclonic loop , Josephine became extratropical on October 18 ."

He returned to the Panthers in early March and scored in one of his first games back against the Tampa Bay Lightning . However , his shoulder troubles continued and it was determined that surgery was required . Horton ended his rookie campaign with 14 goals and 8 assists in 55 games ."

The Kinneys were part of the Twelfth Company of missionaries from the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to arrive in 1848 .

A brief effort to move the tournament to Sweden was quickly put down when Eagleson informed them that neither Hockey Canada nor the National Hockey League Players Association ( NHLPA ) would participate in such an event ."

    "text": "The tidal heating of Io is dependent on its distance from Jupiter , its orbital eccentricity , the composition of its interior , and its physical state . Its Laplace orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io 's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit . The eccentricity leads to vertical differences in Io 's tidal bulge of as much as 100 metres ( 330 ft ) as Jupiter 's gravitational pull varies between the periapsis and apoapsis points in Io 's orbit . This varying tidal pull also produces friction in Io 's interior , enough to cause significant tidal heating and melting . Unlike Earth , where most of its internal heat is released by conduction through the crust , on Io internal heat is released via volcanic activity and generates the satellite 's high heat flow ( global total : 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 6 × 1014 W ) . Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time , and that the current heat flow is not representative of the long @-@ term average . The observed release of heat from Io 's interior is greater than estimates for the amount presently generated from tidal heating , suggesting that Io is cooling after a period of greater flexing ."

Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived to the east of Lake Okeechobee , paid regular tributes to Carlos .

The main village of the Calusa , and home of Carlos , bordered Estero Bay at present @-@ day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico . Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice : when the child of a cacique died , each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed , and when the cacique died , his servants were sacrificed to join him . Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol . The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa . In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long . Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts . Among them he found tools made of bone and shell , pottery , human bones , masks , and animal carvings made of wood ."

Females begin to form reproductive colonies in April and May , either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males .

Mating usually takes place in fall , but sometimes in winter .

The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited : although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather , the effects are relatively small . Unlike many precocial species , chicks are fed by their mother for a few days until they become independent , and this may cushion them from adverse conditions . The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather , with lower survival in large broods ."

    "text": "At the discourse level English tends to use a topic @-@ comment structure , where the known information ( topic ) precedes the new information ( comment ) . Because of the strict SVO syntax , the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence . In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence , frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means . One way of doing this is through a passive construction , the girl was stung by the bee . Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there , e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung , there was a girl who was stung by a bee . Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs ( e.g. , it is raining ) or in existential clauses ( there are many cars on the street ) . Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects , English is able to maintain both a topic comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax ."

    "text": "Differences between Hydnellum species tend to be more distinguishable in younger specimens . Fruitbody development is greatly influenced by environmental factors such as levels of rainfall , drying winds , and temperature . The blue tooth ( H. caeruleum ) , for example , develops a deeper blue color when it grows during cooler autumn weather . Optimal growth occurs during periods of frequent light rains and high humidity ; if the habitat dries out , growth will stop , but may resume after further precipitation . This intermittent growth affects the fruitbodies of different species to variable extents , leading to large variations in form , surface texture , and color . The morphological variability of fruitbodies and the dependence of their appearance upon environmental conditions has made Hydnellum a difficult group to study . Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison , who described several new species from North America , noted \" [ t ] he remarkable longevity of individual sporophores of many species and the changes in appearance that occur during the long period of their development have confused all workers studying this group . \" For example , H. aurantiacum , initially white , becomes in turn shades of orange , rusty @-@ brown , and brownish @-@ black .

In that interval of time the elucidation of the structure of the lower animals and plants had given rise to wholly new conceptions of their relations ; histology and embryology , in the modern sense , had been created ; physiology had been reconstituted ; the facts of distribution , geological and geographical , had been prodigiously multiplied and reduced to order .

I do not think that any impartial judge who reads the Philosophie Zoologique now , and who afterwards takes up Lyell 's trenchant and effectual criticism ( published as far back as 1830 ) , will be disposed to allot to Lamarck a much higher place in the establishment of biological evolution than that which Bacon assigns to himself in relation to physical science generally , — buccinator tantum ."

Because of this ability of two species to hybridize , some biologists have expressed concern that it is a violation of the Endangered Species Act to protect one species that may not be genetically isolated from another .

To this end , in October 1950 , a group of former senior officers produced a document , which became known as the Himmerod memorandum , for West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer .

As with a number of other villains in the Bond novels , there is an echo of World War II , with Goldfinger employing members of the German Luftwaffe , some Japanese and Koreans .

Numerous versions of Karttikeya 's birth story exist , many having a conception from only male input , although heterosexual sex or desire also plays a part . However , Parvati is credited as Karttikeya 's mother due to her having sexual intercourse with Shiva , causing him to ejaculate . Ganga is Karttikeya 's mother in other versions , accepting semen from Agni and carrying the unborn child . The male progenitor is sometimes Shiva , Agni , or a combination of the two . In the Shiva Purana and the Ramayana , the gods fear the outcome of Shiva and Parvati 's \" unending embrace , \" and interrupt their coitus . Shiva then appears before the gods and declares \" now let him step forward who will accept the semen I discharge \" . At the prompting of the gods , Agni captures Shiva 's semen in his hands and swallows it . In these stories , Parvati and Shiva condemn Agni 's actions , calling them \" wicked \" or \" improper . \" In the eleventh century text Kathasaritsagara , however , Shiva forces the reluctant Agni to receive his semen . The semen causes a burning sensation in those that ingest it , prompting Agni to divest it into wives of a group of sages , under Shiva 's advice . The sages ' wives in turn drop the semen into the Ganges river ( the Ganga ) , where it flows to the shore from which Kārttikeya springs . In the Mahabharata , Kārttikeya is also the son of Agni , who ejaculates into the hands of one of the Krittikas ( the Pleiades ) , who in turn throws the semen into a lake , from whence Kārttikeya is born . In some myths , Agni ejaculates onto a mountain that was itself made from Shiva 's divine semen , making Kārttikeya the child of the two gods , according to an interpretation by Markandeya in the Vana Parva ."

    "text": "Debate among mathematicians grew out of opposing views in the philosophy of mathematics regarding the nature of actual infinity . Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate , and denied its existence . Mathematicians from three major schools of thought ( constructivism and its two offshoots , intuitionism and finitism ) opposed Cantor 's theories in this matter . For constructivists such as Kronecker , this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that nonconstructive proofs such as Cantor 's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists , holding instead that constructive proofs are required . Intuitionism also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality , but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism . Firstly , Cantor 's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity , whereas intuitionists hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions , originating instead in the intuitions of the mind . Secondly , the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism , since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set . Mathematicians such as Brouwer and especially Poincaré adopted an intuitionist stance against Cantor 's work . Citing the paradoxes of set theory as an example of its fundamentally flawed nature , Poincaré held that \" most of the ideas of Cantorian set theory should be banished from mathematics once and for all . \" Finally , Wittgenstein 's attacks were finitist : he believed that Cantor 's diagonal argument conflated the intension of a set of cardinal or real numbers with its extension , thus conflating the concept of rules for generating a set with an actual set ."

Successive philosophers to adopt the term put their own personal twist on the concept , each developing the term differently such that it now has no accepted definition . The earliest authors to discuss conatus wrote primarily in Latin , basing their usage on ancient Greek concepts . These thinkers therefore used \" conatus \" not only as a technical term but as a common word and in a general sense . In archaic texts , the more technical usage is difficult to discern from the more common one , and they are also hard to differentiate in translation . In English translations , the term is italicized when used in the technical sense or translated and followed by conatus in brackets . Today , conatus is rarely used in the technical sense , since modern physics uses concepts such as inertia and conservation of momentum that have superseded it . It has , however , been a notable influence on nineteenth- and twentieth @-@ century thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer , Friedrich Nietzsche , and Louis Dumont ."

In March 2003 , twelve disability rights groups , led by Not Dead Yet , along with four other amici , filed an amicus curiae brief in which they opposed the removal of Schiavo 's feeding tube . They also used the Schiavo case to advocate for federal review in cases where third parties decide to withdraw life support from patients unable to give consent . They argued that persistent vegetative state is frequently misdiagnosed , and that the reasons for withdrawal of life support from a patient should be scrutinized since even family member surrogates can have conflicts of interest . The Palm Sunday Compromise granted the federal review they sought , but it was limited to only the Schiavo case ."

In 1147 , Henry intervened in England with a small mercenary army but the expedition failed , not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men . Henry asked his mother for money , but she refused , stating that she had none available . In the end Stephen himself ended up paying off Henry 's mercenaries , allowing him to return home safely ; his reasons for doing so remain unclear ."

The closure of Tuy Hoa Air Base required the group 's 39th Squadron to move to Cam Ranh Bay Air Base in the fall of 1970 . By July 1971 reductions in local base rescue reached the point where the 38th Squadron was inactivated and the few remaining detachments were transferred directly to the group . That same month , the 40th Squadron moved to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base , to better support the campaign against the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos , where air strikes had been concentrated since the bombing halt above the 20th parallel ."

Martin Luther accepted some imagery , but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria . Andreas Karlstadt , Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin were wholly opposed to public religious images , above all in churches , and Calvinism soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism . From 1520 , outbursts of reformist iconoclasm broke out across much of Northern Europe . These might be official and peaceable , as in England under the Tudors and the English Commonwealth , or unofficial and often violent , as in the Beeldenstorm or \" Iconoclastic Fury \" in 1566 in the Netherlands . On 19 August 1566 , this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent , where Marcus van Vaernewijck chronicled the events . He wrote of the Ghent Altarpiece being \" taken to pieces and lifted , panel by panel , into the tower to preserve it from the rioters \" . Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566 , followed by more losses in the Spanish Sack of Antwerp in 1576 , and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581 , which now included city and guild buildings , when Calvinists controlled the city council ."

The resulting violence , she claims , can be read as symbolic of domestic violence within real families . For instance , Frank 's violent acts can be seen to reflect the different types of abuse within families , and the control he has over Dorothy might represent the hold an abusive husband has over his wife . Michael Atkinson reads Jeffrey as an innocent youth who is both horrified by the violence inflicted by Frank , but also tempted by it as the means of possessing Dorothy for himself . Atkinson takes a Freudian approach to the film ; considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynch 's work . He claims that \" Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother [ figure ] because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy , infantile impulses at work in Jeffrey 's subconscious \" ."

The erotic nature was obvious to listeners , but a deeper aspect of the fusion between black gospel music and R & B troubled many black audiences .

The moral controversy surrounding the song has been attributed to its popularity ; Charles later acknowledged in an interview that the beat was catchy , but it was the suggestive lyrics that attracted listeners : \" ' See the girl with the diamond ring .

The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis , keratitis , in immunocompromised ( transplant ) patients , or disseminated herpes zoster .

The introduction of 9 @-@ β @-@ D @-@ arabinofuranosyladenine , ( ara @-@ A or vidarabine ) , considerably less toxic than ara @-@ C , in the mid @-@ 1970s , heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment .

The introduction of 9- ( 2 @-@ hydroxyethoxymethyl ) guanine , AKA acyclovir , in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s . The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998 . Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages , which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine . However , acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response , and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine ."

    "text": "There is concern in some quarters that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat , through overgrazing and competition with native species . While exotic species , such as the Namib Desert Horse , are generally unwanted in the Namib @-@ Naukluft Park , the horses are a special case , given their close ties with Namibian history , their popularity with visitors , and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands . Studies during 2003 and 2004 , however , found that while an area of approximately 100 metres ( 330 ft ) around the watering area at Garub has been affected by the horses , there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius . The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses , probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing . Due to the lack of affect on vegetation by horses , it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations . The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species , which in several cases are more threatened by human influence . As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not , the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species . The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as \" ghost horses \" , as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen . However , when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve , a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary , bringing the horses into closer contact with humans . This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia , who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds . While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia , there are also concerns about negative horse @-@ human interactions , including vehicle accidents , disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans ."

    "text": "The musculature of the face , jaw and tongue is specialised for feeding . The tongue is the animal 's sole means of catching prey , and can protrude up to 180 mm ( 7 in ) outside the snout . The snout 's shape , resembling a double wedge , gives it a significant mechanical advantage in generating a large moment , so makes it efficient for digging to reach prey or to build a shelter . The tongue is sticky because of the presence of glycoprotein @-@ rich mucus , which both lubricates movement in and out of the snout and helps to catch ants and termites , which adhere to it . The tongue is protruded by contracting circular muscles that change the shape of the tongue and force it forwards and contracting two genioglossal muscles attached to the caudal end of the tongue and to the mandible . The protruded tongue is stiffened by a rapid flow of blood , which allows it to penetrate wood and soil . Retraction requires the contraction of two internal longitudinal muscles , known as the sternoglossi . When the tongue is retracted , the prey is caught on backward @-@ facing keratinous \" teeth \" , located along the roof of the buccal cavity , allowing the animal both to capture and grind food . The tongue moves with great speed , and has been measured to move in and out of the snout 100 times a minute . This is partly achieved through the elasticity of the tongue and the conversion of elastic potential energy into kinetic energy . The tongue is very flexible , particularly at the end , allowing it to bend in U @-@ turns and catch insects attempting to flee in their twisty nests or mounds . The tongue also has an ability to avoid picking up splinters while foraging in logs ; the reason for this ability is unknown .

Orlin Tremaine , the editor of Comet — a competing science fiction magazine — and discovered that Tremaine was irate at the idea of a magazine that might \" siphon readership from magazines that paid \" by taking stories without paying the authors . Tremaine felt that any author who contributed a story to these magazines should be blacklisted . Asimov acknowledged that a story of his would be appearing in Cosmic , but told Tremaine that he had been paid for it . In Asimov 's autobiographical anthology The Early Asimov he recalls that after hearing Tremaine 's comments he requested a token payment of $ 5 from Wollheim ; in Asimov 's autobiography In Memory Yet Green the sequence of events is given slightly differently , with Asimov asking Wollheim for payment , or else for the story to be published under a pseudonym , before the story was published . This was requested on the grounds that \" even though the story might be worth nothing , my name was worth something \" . Wollheim reluctantly agreed to a payment of $ 5 , commenting that it was an effective word rate of $ 2 @.@ 50 per word , since he was paying only for the use of Asimov 's name .

Wilson and McNaughton 1994 , and numerous later studies , reported that when hippocampal place cells have overlapping spatial firing fields ( and therefore often fire in near @-@ simultaneity ) , they tend to show correlated activity during sleep following the behavioral session . This enhancement of correlation , commonly known as reactivation , has been found to occur mainly during sharp waves . It has been proposed that sharp waves are , in fact , reactivations of neural activity patterns that were memorized during behavior , driven by strengthening of synaptic connections within the hippocampus . This idea forms a key component of the \" two @-@ stage memory \" theory , advocated by Buzsáki and others , which proposes that memories are stored within the hippocampus during behavior and then later transferred to the neocortex during sleep .

For example , Levinson specifically asked that a dead body found by detectives in \" Gone for Goode \" be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way . Some episodes , like \" Ghost of a Chance \" , focus on murders that take place in wealthy rural settings , rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did . Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances . In striving for realism , some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free , most notably in the Adena Watson case . This theme often put the show 's producers at odds with NBC executives , who wanted happier endings with more closure . Fontana said of the Watson investigation , \" We never solved it because we felt that it would be a disservice to the real girl , to have this fake TV solution . Because it 's not O.K. that she died , that no one took responsibility . \""

In the fall of 1938 , the increased pressure on Jewish property nourished the party 's ambition , especially since Hjalmar Schacht had been ousted as Reich minister for economics . This , however , was only one aspect of the origin of the November 1938 pogrom . The Polish government threatened to extradite all Jews who were Polish citizens , but would stay in Germany , thus creating a burden of responsibility on the German side . The immediate reaction by the Gestapo was to push the Polish Jews — 16 @,@ 000 persons — over the borderline , but this measure failed due to the stubbornness of the Polish customs officers . The loss of prestige as a result of this abortive operation called for some sort of compensation . Thus , the overreaction to Herschel Grynszpan 's attempt against the diplomat Ernst vom Rath came into being and led to the November pogrom . The background of the pogrom was signified by a sharp cleavage of interests between the different agencies of party and state .

Their nests are mounds built from finely granular gravel , soil and pebbles , measuring 20 to 60 centimetres ( 8 to 24 in ) in diameter and can be as tall as half of a metre ( 20 in ) in height . Two types of nests for this species have been described : one being a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside , the other being a complex structure surrounded by a mound . These ants utilise the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat in a quick duration , providing the nest with solar energy traps . They decorate their nests with seeds , soil , charcoal , stones , sticks , and even small invertebrate corpses . They also camouflage their nests by covering leaf litter , debris and long grass over the nest .

The Japanese then used the Sultan 's residence of Istana Bukit Serene located in the town as their main temporary base for their future initial plans to conquest Singapore while waiting to reconnect the causeway . The Japanese chose the palace as their main base because they already knew the British would not dare to attack it as this would harm their close relationship with Johor ."

More anatomical work was done during the 18th century , but it was not until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained . Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that damage to the cerebellum results in motor disturbances . Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work , which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move , but with a loss of coordination ( strange movements , awkward gait , and muscular weakness ) , and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive . By the beginning of the 20th century , it was widely accepted that the primary function of the cerebellum relates to motor control ; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans ."

These include many birds of prey such as vultures , eagles , and buzzards , but also storks . These birds migrate in the daytime . Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water , since thermals only form over land , and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances . Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds , which must cross at the narrowest points . Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina , Gibraltar , Falsterbo , and the Bosphorus at migration times . More common species , such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus , can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn . Other barriers , such as mountain ranges , can also cause funnelling , particularly of large diurnal migrants . This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck . Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth . Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains , hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi , Georgia . Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20 % of their weight during migration , which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons , hawks and harriers ."

The specific crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany , then held at Corfe Castle , to King Louis IX of France . Maulay was imprisoned for a short time , but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king . He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom . The accusation may have owed more to the fact that Maulay had recently taken Mucegros ' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment due for a royal fine . The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay 's patron and de Burgh 's rival for power , Peter des Roches , while des Roches was out of England . The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches ' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches ' standing and power . In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental in the clearing of Maulay from the charges of treason . Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe , but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine . The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe , but the real reason appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe . In late 1221 Maulay agreed to go on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breauté , another of des Roches supporters . The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure , and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff . In return for Maulay 's agreement to the ouster , the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government , this time over 8800 marks . Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire ."

Dudley again rallied the provincial militias for a planned expedition against Quebec in 1709 , but the supporting expedition from England was called off .

B. prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups . It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark , and so cannot be considered a resprouter ; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height , the sparseness of its foliage , and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier . On the other hand , it is not a typical reseeder either , because of its relatively low fire mortality rates , and because it is only weakly serotinous : although fire promotes seed release , seed release still occurs in the absence of fire ."

Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years , beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself . Biographer Forrest McDonald argues that Hamilton saw his office , like that of the British First Lord of the Treasury , as the equivalent of a Prime Minister ; Hamilton would oversee his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington . Washington did request Hamilton 's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the Treasury Department . In 1791 , while Secretary , Hamilton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . Hamilton submitted various financial reports to Congress . Among these are the First Report on the Public Credit , Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports , Report on a National Bank , On the Establishment of a Mint , Report on Manufactures , and the Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit .

When the breach was completed , two Russian regiments ( 13th ' Belozerskiy ' and 14th ' Olonetskiy ' ) charged into the gap .

The trade was so important that Scottish colonies were established in these ports . In the early seventeenth century famine was relatively common , with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625 . The English invasions of the 1640s had a profound impact on the Scottish economy , with the destruction of crops and the disruption of markets resulting in some of the most rapid price rises of the century . Under the Commonwealth , the country was relatively highly taxed , but gained access to English markets . After the Restoration the formal frontier with England was re @-@ established , along with its customs duties .

The closing decade of the seventeenth century saw the generally favourable economic conditions that had dominated since the Restoration come to an end .

The result was severe famine and depopulation , particularly in the north . The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe , partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century , with only one year of dearth ( in 1674 ) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind ."

This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers , who live in a culture where \" real men \" are expected to care little for their clothing . Conversely , the film 's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms , which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall 's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation . This uniform helps set Wentworth apart from many of the other male characters , allowing him to appear romantic but isolated . Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film , writing that it accurately captures Austen 's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes ' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy .

The slate mill evolved between 1840 and 1860 , powered by a single line shaft running along the building and bringing together operations such as sawing , planing and dressing . In 1859 , John Whitehead Greaves invented the Greaves sawing table to produce blocks for the splitter , then in 1856 introduced a rotary machine to dress the split slate . The splitting of the blocks to produce roofing slates proved resistant to mechanization , and continued to be done with a mallet and chisel . An extra source of income from the 1860s was the production of \" slab \" , thicker pieces of slate which were planed and used for many purposes , for example flooring , tombstones and billiard tables ."

The upper midline of the nasal bones had a triangular sagittal crest , which was narrow and sharp in front . The lacrimal bone appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen , for example , on Allosaurus . The dentary was very long and shallow , with a prominent Meckelian groove .

They consulted Paul Ekman , a well @-@ known psychologist who studies emotions , and Dacher Keltner , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Berkeley . Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions — anger , fear , sadness , disgust , joy , and surprise .

Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were schadenfreude , ennui , pride , and hope . Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships . Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions ."

    "text": "The entorhinal cortex ( EC ) , located in the parahippocampal gyrus , is considered to be part of the hippocampal region because of its anatomical connections . The EC is strongly and reciprocally connected with many other parts of the cerebral cortex . In addition , the medial septal nucleus , the anterior nuclear complex and nucleus reuniens of the thalamus and the supramammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus , as well as the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus in the brainstem send axons to the EC . The main output pathway ( perforant path , first described by Ramon y Cajal ) of EC axons comes from the large pyramidal cells in layer II that \" perforate \" the subiculum and project densely to the granule cells in the dentate gyrus , apical dendrites of CA3 get a less dense projection , and the apical dendrites of CA1 get a sparse projection . Thus , the perforant path establishes the EC as the main \" interface \" between the hippocampus and other parts of the cerebral cortex . The dentate granule cell axons ( called mossy fibers ) pass on the information from the EC on thorny spines that exit from the proximal apical dendrite of CA3 pyramidal cells . Then , CA3 axons exit from the deep part of the cell body and loop up into the region where the apical dendrites are located , then extend all the way back into the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex — the Schaffer collaterals completing the reciprocal circuit ; field CA1 also sends axons back to the EC , but these are more sparse than the CA3 projection . Within the hippocampus , the flow of information from the EC is largely unidirectional , with signals propagating through a series of tightly packed cell layers , first to the dentate gyrus , then to the CA3 layer , then to the CA1 layer , then to the subiculum , then out of the hippocampus to the EC , mainly due to collateralization of the CA3 axons . Each of these layers also contains complex intrinsic circuitry and extensive longitudinal connections ."

If enough magma is erupted , the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it . A roughly circular fracture — a \" ring fault \" — develops around the edge of the chamber . These ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes . Secondary volcanic vents form above the ring fracture . As the magma chamber empties , the centre of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse . The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption , or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions . These caldera collapses are relatively small compared to most other caldera collapses . The largest caldera at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is about 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) in diameter while most calderas are at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in diameter . Volcanic eruptions accompanying these collapses produced trachyte and a white , sodic rhyolite called comendite ."

As a result , any change in arc length ( which is directly related to voltage ) results in a large change in heat input and current .

This helps operators keep the arc length consistent even when manually welding with hand @-@ held welding guns . To achieve a similar effect , sometimes a constant current power source is used in combination with an arc voltage @-@ controlled wire feed unit .

The position of the head , in relation to the heads of Bradshaw and Ireton , was called into question . Pearson and Morant argued in the 1930s that the originally understood position — traditionally , Bradshaw 's head was in the middle , with Cromwell to the right and Ireton to the left — could be disputed , as they reveal in their study . Although they upheld the originally understood position through careful analysis of contemporary poems and plans , the circumstances in which it came into private ownership are rumoured to be tied with a great storm towards the end of James II 's reign ( 1685 – 1689 ) , which broke the pole bearing the head , throwing it to the ground . A sentinel guarding the Exchequer 's Office came across it , after which he hid it under his cloak and stored it , hidden , in the chimney of his house . The loss of the head was still significant in London at the time , and many searched for it , hoping to claim the “ considerable reward ” being offered for its safe return . The guard , however , after seeing “ the placards which ordered any one possessing it to take it to a certain office ... was afraid to divulge the secret ” . However , only circumstantial evidence has been established for the whereabouts of the head following its fall from Westminster Hall until 1710 , when it was in the possession of Claudius Du Puy , a Swiss @-@ French collector of curiosities , who displayed it in his private museum in London . According to Fitzgibbons , Du Puy 's museum was internationally famous and ranked among the top attractions in London at the time , attracting visitors such as a traveller named Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach , who was not impressed by what he saw . After hearing Du Puys boast that he could sell the head for as much as 60 guineas ( £ 63 , or the equivalent of about £ 5000 in today 's British money ) , Uffenbach exclaimed his surprise that \" this monstrous head could still be so dear and worthy to the English \" ."

Among the guests were Elgar , Beecham , Otto Klemperer , Bruno Walter , Wilhelm Furtwängler and Serge Koussevitzky ; soloists in the 1920s included Sergei Rachmaninoff , Artur Schnabel and the young Yehudi Menuhin . Revenues were substantial , and the orchestra seemed to many to be entering into a golden age . In fact , for lack of any serious competition in the 1920s , the LSO allowed its standards of playing to slip . In 1927 the Berlin Philharmonic , under Furtwängler , gave two concerts at the Queen 's Hall . These , and later concerts by the same orchestra in 1928 and 1929 , made obvious the poor standards then prevailing in London . Both the BBC and Beecham had ambitions to bring London 's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin . After an early attempt at co @-@ operation between the BBC and Beecham , they went their separate ways . In 1929 the BBC began recruiting for the new BBC Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult . The prospect of joining a permanent , salaried orchestra was attractive enough to induce some LSO players to defect . The new orchestra immediately received enthusiastic reviews that contrasted starkly with the severe press criticisms of the LSO 's playing . According to the critic W J Turner the LSO 's problem was not that its playing had deteriorated , but that it had failed to keep up with the considerable improvements in playing achieved over the past two decades by the best European and American orchestras ."

    "text": "Spices were among the most luxurious products available in the Middle Ages , the most common being black pepper , cinnamon ( and the cheaper alternative cassia ) , cumin , nutmeg , ginger and cloves . They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa , which made them extremely expensive , and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded , traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion . It has been estimated that around 1 @,@ 000 tons of pepper and 1 @,@ 000 tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages . The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1 @.@ 5 million people . While pepper was the most common spice , the most exclusive ( though not the most obscure in its origin ) was saffron , used as much for its vivid yellow @-@ red color as for its flavor , for according to the humours , yellow signified hot and dry , valued qualities ; turmeric provided a yellow substitute , and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore : at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473 , the bread was gilded . Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise , a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking , long pepper , mace , spikenard , galangal and cubeb . Sugar , unlike today , was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities . Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb , but rather a combination of several different ones . Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste , for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger ."

    "text": "The further evolution of Callisto after accretion was determined by the balance of the radioactive heating , cooling through thermal conduction near the surface , and solid state or subsolidus convection in the interior . Details of the subsolidus convection in the ice is the main source of uncertainty in the models of all icy moons . It is known to develop when the temperature is sufficiently close to the melting point , due to the temperature dependence of ice viscosity . Subsolidus convection in icy bodies is a slow process with ice motions of the order of 1 centimeter per year , but is , in fact , a very effective cooling mechanism on long timescales . It is thought to proceed in the so @-@ called stagnant lid regime , where a stiff , cold outer layer of Callisto conducts heat without convection , whereas the ice beneath it convects in the subsolidus regime . For Callisto , the outer conductive layer corresponds to the cold and rigid lithosphere with a thickness of about 100 km . Its presence would explain the lack of any signs of the endogenic activity on the Callistoan surface . The convection in the interior parts of Callisto may be layered , because under the high pressures found there , water ice exists in different crystalline phases beginning from the ice I on the surface to ice VII in the center . The early onset of subsolidus convection in the Callistoan interior could have prevented large @-@ scale ice melting and any resulting differentiation that would have otherwise formed a large rocky core and icy mantle . Due to the convection process , however , very slow and partial separation and differentiation of rocks and ices inside Callisto has been proceeding on timescales of billions of years and may be continuing to this day ."

The resulting grand coalition cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgish politics ; besides Thorn himself , there were the conservatives Léon Kauffmann and Antoine Lefort , the socialist leader Dr Michel Welter , and the liberal Léon Moutrier ."

When presented with a second instar larva of Urbanus proteus , the corn earworm larvae grasps the insect , rolls onto its side to form a semicircle , and begins feeding on the insect 's posterior end . If the U. proteus begins to bite out of defense , Helicoverpa zea rotates the larva 180 degrees and uses its mandibles to puncture the head capsule , killing the insect . Then , the H. zea larva rotates the U. proteus back to its original position and continues feeding until the insect is entirely consumed . Even when presented with up to 5 U. proteus larvae , the Helicoverpa zea engages in the unique behavior , as the larvae have a higher affinity for Lepidopterous prey over plant material . Helicoverpa zea raised in a low moisture environment have lower pupal weight and a longer developmental time than those raised in environments of high moisture , so there is a nutritional benefit to such aggressive feeding behavior under such conditions ."

The election for his successor came at a time of public debate about the nature of British missionary work in India , particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . The East India Company , which controlled the British territories until they were absorbed into the British Empire in 1858 , had had a general policy until 1813 of non @-@ interference with Indian customs , including religion . Christian missionaries required a licence to proselytize . In practice , most could operate without a licence , except for Evangelicals , who were regarded as too radical in an age when Christians from other backgrounds were more prepared to be tolerant of other faiths . As the Evangelical movement grew in strength , it pressed for greater efforts to bring Christianity to India , and so the company relaxed its approach to missionaries in 1813 . After 1858 , the British government was reluctant to provoke further unrest by interference with local traditions and religion , but many of those charged with running India were themselves Evangelicals sympathetic to efforts to convert the country . As Beckerlegge has commented , \" the furtherance of Christian mission had become inextricably bound up with attempts to define Britain 's role in India and indeed to justify Britain 's presence in India . \" The issue was whether Britain was there simply to govern India or to \" civilise \" it , and if the latter , whether to draw up or destroy India 's existing culture and religion . Many of those who supported increased missionary work in India , says Beckerlegge , regarded the events of 1857 as \" nothing less than a divine judgment \" on Britain 's failure to bring Christianity to the country ."

The bone is 19 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 77 in ) long and 11 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 45 in ) deep .

In a surprise move , Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989 , an invitation Mandela considered genial . Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later ; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners . Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 , de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela . Although some were deeply opposed to his plans , de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation , a meeting both men considered friendly , before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela 's unconditional release . Shortly thereafter , for the first time in 20 years , photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa ."

    "text": "The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes , though . In many parts of the brain , axons initially \" overgrow \" , and then are \" pruned \" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity . In the projection from the eye to the midbrain , for example , the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping , connecting each point on the surface of the retina to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer . In the first stages of development , each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues , but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons . The retina , before birth , contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer . These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time ; that is , they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons . This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken , and eventually vanish , if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell . The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map , leaving it finally in its precise adult form ."

The old , widely cited idea that all large dinosaurs , implicitly also Plateosaurus , swallowed gastroliths to digest food because of their relatively limited ability to deal with food orally has been refuted by a study on gastrolith abundance , weight , and surface structure in fossils compared to alligators and ostriches by Oliver Wings . The use of gastroliths for digestion seems to have developed on the line from basal theropods to birds , with a parallel development in Psittacosaurus ."

    "text": "Inherent errors may fall into several categories , each affecting different instruments . Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude . This type of error is caused by variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere . A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube . At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation ( see calibrated airspeed ) correctly accounts for the compression so there is no compressibility error at sea level . At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed . A correction may be obtained from a chart . Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) and at airspeeds greater than 200 knots ( 370 km / h ) . Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments . These capsules , used to determine pressure differences , have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape , even though the external forces may have changed . Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading . This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft 's pitch . A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction . Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators ."

Many of these were eaten daily by peasants and workers , but were less prestigious than meat . The cookbooks , which appeared in the late Middle Ages and were intended mostly for those who could afford such luxuries , contained only a small number of recipes using vegetables as the main ingredient . The lack of recipes for many basic vegetable dishes , such as potages , has been interpreted not to mean that they were absent from the meals of the nobility , but rather that they were considered so basic that they did not require recording . Carrots were available in many variants during the Middle Ages : among them a tastier reddish @-@ purple variety and a less prestigious green @-@ yellow type . Various legumes , like chickpeas , fava beans and field peas were also common and important sources of protein , especially among the lower classes .

He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on a commitment to the ideal of popular self @-@ government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves . Flourishing in a world in which slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization , Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult . He believed that the spread of slavery improved public morals by ridding the countryside of the shiftless poor whites who had once held the region back . He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic @-@ mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed . From such a standpoint , the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self @-@ worth , as had happened in New England . Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream ."

    "text": "Chinese kinship relations during the Han were influenced by Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members . The Chinese family was patrilineal , since a father 's sons did not consider a mother 's kin to be part of their clan ; instead , they were considered ' outside relatives ' . The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BCE ) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes . This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period ( 220 – 265 CE ) . The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members , which was unlike the large extended families under one household in later dynasties . It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally , yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 CE ) , a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal . Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other 's families . However , a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare . This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty ( 265 – 420 ) , when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace ."

The name \" Herdwick \" is derived from the Old Norse herdvyck , meaning sheep pasture . Though low in lambing capacity and perceived wool quality when compared to more common commercial breeds such as Merino sheep , Herdwicks are prized for their robust health , their ability to live solely on forage , and their tendency to be territorial and not to stray over the difficult upland terrain of the Lake District . It is considered that up to 99 % of all Herdwick sheep are commercially farmed in the central and western Lake District ."

To address this problem , the United Nations produced a report in 1951 with solutions for underdeveloped countries . They suggested that they can expand their markets by forming customs unions with neighbouring countries . Also , they can adopt the system of preferential taxation or even abolish customs duties altogether . The logic was that once customs duties are removed , transport costs will fall . Consequently , prices will fall and thus the demand will rise . However , Nurkse , as an export pessimist , did not agree with this view .

Encountering a village , the 3rd Platoon cleared the village and killed two Chinese stragglers . After the lead elements of the tank company and the 3rd Platoon had taken the Kantongyon village , the tank company commander wanted to move his company west into the center of the valley before continuing north . Captain and now Executive Officer , Bob Channon was near the rear of the company column . CO , Jess Tidwell , riding with the tank Co , called Channon on the radio and instructed him to come up and take control of the 1st and 2nd Platoons . By the time Channon reached the two platoons , they were crossing over two small hills just north of Kantongyon . As they crossed over one of the hills , Channon and his radio operator were wounded by Chinese mortar rounds . Channon took the radio from Walker , who was now incapacitated , and joined the two platoons at the bottom of the hill . Channon then called Jess Tidwell for instructions , who responded , “ move out when the tanks move out . ” Two tanks had passed through a gap in the hills and were in front of them . Soon , the two tanks moved out at high speed to join their company in the center of the valley . As the Rangers started to move forward , toward the nose of a ridge from which the fire was coming about 700 @-@ 800 yards ahead , they began taking casualties from machine gun and rifle fire . About 100 yards out from the ridge , they received a heavy mortar barrage , resulting in a number of them being wounded . Channon also received a couple of burp gun rounds to his lower left leg . Shortly after , a couple of light tanks arrived . Pete Hamilton ( 1st Plt Ldr ) and Channon crawled up on the tanks , bore @-@ sighted the guns on the machine guns and blew them away . About 30 yards out from a Chinese trench at the base of the ridge nose , they received a heavy volley of grenades . Abandoning protocol ( once you start a charge , you are not supposed to hit the ground ) , Channon , knowing that he ’ d have no trouble getting his Rangers up again , had them hit the ground . When they got up , the Rangers took the ridge nose in a bayonet and grenade fight . When their position was secure , Platoon Sergeant Barber reported that they only had eight Rangers capable of continuing on . Pete Hamilton had been too seriously wounded to continue . Channon called Tidwell for instructions and was instructed to join the tanks and the 3rd Platoon in the center of the valley . The 2nd Platoon had been supporting the 1st Platoon with enfilade fire on the hill from their left flank . Channon put the 2nd Platoon in the lead , followed by the remnant of the 1st Platoon . The tanks and the 3rd Platoon had moved up the center of the wide valley and were more than a thousand yards to the northwest . Fortunately , after about 300 yards of sniper fire from higher on the ridge to their right , they were able to gain cover from a 3 @-@ 4 foot field dyke , and then joined the 3rd Platoon in the center of the valley . Channon moved the company up around the tanks on a small hill ahead . The tank company commander then moved the tanks up to the final objective for the day about 300 @-@ 400 yards ahead . Jess Tildwell was with him , so Channon brought the company up to that small hill and got it organized . Bob Scully , Channon 's third radio operator for the day , was wounded when a mortar round hit . Jess Tildwell had Channon get on a tank with other wounded for the trip back to clearing station . On the way back Channon noticed that there was more than a two thousand yard gap before they saw any fighting elements . So before continuing on , he had a jeep take him to the tank battalion CP . He strongly suggested the gap be closed before dark , which was done and 3rd Company was replaced on line . In addition to those wounded who were able to continue on , four Rangers were killed along with 25 wounded and evacuated in this first engagement ."

It contains an entirely new style of prose — deeply musical , frankly poetic , and full of gods and almost @-@ gods , yet containing considerable narrative momentum . At the same time , the novel as a whole is pessimistic . It ends with Macunaíma 's willful destruction of his own village ; despite the euphoria of the collision , the meeting of cultures the novel documents is inevitably catastrophic . As Severino João Albuquerque has demonstrated , the novel presents \" construction and destruction \" as inseparable . It is a novel of both power ( Macunaíma has all kinds of strange powers ) and alienation ."

Humanist education was based on the programme of ' Studia Humanitatis ' , the study of five humanities : poetry , grammar , history , moral philosophy and rhetoric . Although historians have sometimes struggled to define humanism precisely , most have settled on \" a middle of the road definition ... the movement to recover , interpret , and assimilate the language , literature , learning and values of ancient Greece and Rome \" .
