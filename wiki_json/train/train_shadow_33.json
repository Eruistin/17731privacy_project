When the engine was run , severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail , searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice . While doing so , soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land . Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen , a previously uncharted harbour was found , which Algarsson named after Worsley . The ship then sailed north , still seeking Gillis Land , but became trapped in the ice . Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder , which had become damaged . After two weeks beset in the ice , he used the engine to break free but the last blade of the propeller was lost in the process ."

    "text": "The episode received generally positive reviews from critics . HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that \" Timothy Dalton was everything we had come to expect from him in the part : scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf . The episode left [ Alexei ] ' s sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends , or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan ? - but Volkoff is such a well @-@ drawn character , and Dalton so talented and versatile , that the comedy worked either way ... Vivian , on the other hand ? I 'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance , and putting her on camera with [ Alexei ] , even briefly , was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table . \" Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A- . Though he praised Dalton 's performance , McGee wrote , \" The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven 't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it . Let 's face it : These two aren 't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another . The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side . It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times , but never Chuck . At this point , he 's as set in his moral code as possible . Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2 @.@ 0 days , perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head , with Vivian as an example of the road not taken . As such , Vivian 's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show , not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations . \" Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10 , writing , \" This Chuck got off to a shaky start . I don 't know how to put my finger on it exactly , but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode ... Thankfully , things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I 'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates . The way Chuck 's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny , as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno ( for his life ) , but that the pirate did indeed have the game . \" Carl Cortez of Assignment X , however , gave the episode a negative review , calling it \" a painfully nonsense driven episode that 's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline . \""

It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter , and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum ( Eucalyptus globulus ) during the breeding season in spring . The flowering of royal grevillea ( Grevillea victoriae ) over summer in subalpine areas in the Snowy Mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters . It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath ( Astroloma conostephioides ) it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute . Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of Banksia species , waratah ( Telopea ) , tubular flowered genera including Astroloma , Epacris and Correa , mistletoes of the genus Amyema , and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia . In Bondi State Forest it was also recorded feeding at cluster @-@ flower geebung ( Persoonia confertiflora ) , native holly ( Lomatia ilicifolia ) , tall shaggy @-@ pea ( Oxylobium arborescens ) , silver wattle ( Acacia dealbata ) and blackthorn ( Bursaria spinosa ) . Local differences in flower foraging patterns have been observed in South Australia ; populations on Kangaroo Island forage more often at Adenanthos flowers than those in the nearby Fleurieu Peninsula , while the latter forage more often at eucalypt blooms , and at a higher diversity of plants overall ."

When he awoke , he pulled a few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots . Contrary to some portraits of him as a farmer who stumbled upon his discovery by dumb luck , Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold . Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior , but the Lopez gold find was the first popularly documented incident in the area . This sparked a gold rush on a much smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush .

In the late 1940s , there was a move against modernism in art , and tonalism came into favour .

Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment , who after World War II was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria 's painting school . Influenced by Bell , Stokes was among the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence , and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists .

A provincial government committee report recommended an additional seven options for the modification of the causeway in May 1992 , but the government did not act upon any of these options due to the low \" cost @-@ benefit \" factor . More reports documented problems related to the passage of fish in the river until 1995 , when the Department of Transportation agreed to open one gate from April to December , as suggested four years earlier . A project was then organized in December 1996 to begin a trial for the systematic opening of the gates during the year , but conditions could not be physically met , and it was terminated on 1 June 1999 ."

The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue ( known as emphysema ) and small airways disease ( known as obstructive bronchiolitis ) . The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people . Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets — known as bullae — that replace lung tissue .

The caliph was the Ottoman Emperor , who would be deprived of both offices following his nation 's defeat in the First World War .

He continued by rejecting an offer of assistance made by the North Vietnamese government , and instead told them to enter negotiations in the United Nations Security Council . After Khrushchev 's ousting , Brezhnev resumed aiding the communist resistance in Vietnam . In February 1965 , Kosygin travelled to Hanoi with a dozen Soviet air force generals and economic experts . During the Soviet visit , President Lyndon B. Johnson had authorised U.S. bombing raids on North Vietnamese soil in retaliation for a recent attack by the Viet Cong . Johnson privately suggested to Brezhnev that he would guarantee an end to South Vietnamese hostility if Brezhnev would guarantee a North Vietnamese one . Brezhnev was interested in this offer initially , but after being told by Andrei Gromyko that the North Vietnamese government was not interested in a diplomatic solution to the war , Brezhnev rejected the offer . The Johnson administration responded to this rejection by expanding the American presence in Vietnam , but later invited the USSR to negotiate a treaty concerning arms control . The USSR simply did not respond , initially because Brezhnev and Kosygin were fighting over which of them had the right to represent the USSR abroad , but later because of the escalation of the \" dirty war \" in Vietnam . In early 1967 , Johnson offered to make a deal with Ho Chi Minh , and said he was prepared to end U.S. bombing raids in North Vietnam if Ho ended his infiltration of South Vietnam . The U.S. bombing raids halted for a few days and Kosygin publicly announced his support for this offer . The North Vietnamese government failed to respond , and because of this , the U.S. continued its raids in North Vietnam . The Brezhnev leadership concluded from this event that seeking diplomatic solutions to the ongoing war in Vietnam was hopeless . Later in 1968 , Johnson invited Kosygin to the United States to discuss ongoing problems in Vietnam and the arms race .

Their prospectus for the publication , published November 21 , 1846 , announced their intentions to create a magazine \" to circle around the family table \" . Willis intended the magazine for the middle and lower classes and included the message of upward social mobility , using himself as an example , often describing in detail his personal possessions . When discussing his own social climbing , however , he emphasized his frustrations rather than his successes , endearing him to his audience . He edited the Home Journal until his death in 1867 . It was renamed Town & Country in 1901 , and it is still published under that title as of 2011 . During Willis 's time at the journal , he especially promoted the works of women poets , including Frances Sargent Osgood , Anne Lynch Botta , Grace Greenwood , and Julia Ward Howe . Willis and his editors favorably reviewed many works now considered important today , including Henry David Thoreau 's Walden and Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Blithedale Romance ."

    "text": "The flowers of B. sessilis have a number of adaptations that serve to encourage outcrossing . Firstly , they are protandrous : a flower 's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen , by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability . Secondly , the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active , so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination . This has proven an effective strategy : almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation . In addition , honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants , rather than between inflorescences on the same plant , at least in high density sites . These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen . When self @-@ fertilisation does occur , whether autogamous or geitonogamous , the resulting seed is almost always aborted , and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100 % , at least in high density sites .

    "text": "The argument from intelligent design appears to have begun with Socrates , although the concept of a cosmic intelligence is older and David Sedley has argued that Socrates was developing an older idea , citing Anaxagoras of Clazomenae , born about 500 BC , as a possible earlier proponent . The proposal that the order of nature showed evidence of having its own human @-@ like \" intelligence \" goes back to the origins of Greek natural philosophy and science , and its attention to the orderliness of nature , often with special reference to the revolving of the heavens . Anaxagoras is the first person who is definitely known to have explained such a concept using the word \" nous \" ( which is the original Greek term that leads to modern English \" intelligence \" via its Latin and French translations ) . Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from Clazomenae named Hermotimus who had taken a similar position . Amongst Pre @-@ Socratic philosophers before Anaxagoras , other philosophers had proposed a similar intelligent ordering principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens . For example Empedocles , like Hesiod much earlier , described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of love , and Pythagoras and Heraclitus attributed the cosmos with \" reason \" ( logos ) . In his Philebus 28c Plato has Socrates speak of this as a tradition , saying that \" all philosophers agree — whereby they really exalt themselves — that mind ( nous ) is king of heaven and earth . Perhaps they are right . \" and later states that the ensuing discussion \" confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind ( nous ) always rules the universe \" ."

Nevertheless , he did not advocate an immediate disfranchisement of rotten boroughs . He instead proposed that a third member be added to each county , to countervail the borough influence . The Whigs failed to unite behind the expansion of county representation ; some objected to the idea because they felt that it would give too much power to the aristocracy and gentry in rural areas . Ultimately , despite Chatham 's exertions , Parliament took no action on his proposals . The cause of parliamentary reform was next taken up by Lord Chatham 's son , William Pitt the Younger ( variously described as a Tory and as an \" independent Whig \" ) .

The House of Commons rejected Pitt 's resolution by over 140 votes , despite receiving petitions for reform bearing over twenty thousand signatures .

During a simulation exercise at the College , Murray broke new ground by planning large convoys - convoys that were regarded at the time as \" almost suicidal \" , but which had become normal by the time of the Battle of the Atlantic . Upon return to Canada in January 1929 , Murray was promoted to Commander and became the senior naval officer at CFB Esquimalt . In notes for a lecture to RMC Kingston in 1932 , his continuing interest in the offensive merit of convoys over patrols is evident :"

    "text": "These supernovae , like those of Type II , are massive stars that undergo core collapse . However the stars which become Types Ib and Ic supernovae have lost most of their outer ( hydrogen ) envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion . These stars are known as Wolf @-@ Rayet stars , and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates . Observations of type Ib / c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of Wolf Rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions . Binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae , with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed . Since a supernova explosion can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole , any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs ."

    "text": "Into Temptation is also a story of redemption , both for Linda , who is seeking redemption for a life of sin and prostitution , and for Father John , who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood . At the start of the film , Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation ; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time . Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood . But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda , his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored , and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest . The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness , particularly in the way that John 's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life . The film also advocates repentance , and the extent of Linda 's victimization can be interpreted as a sign of how catastrophic an unrepentant life can be ."

This ancient work was further developed in the Middle Ages by Muslim physicians and scholars such as Avicenna . During the European Renaissance and early modern period , biological thought was revolutionized in Europe by a renewed interest in empiricism and the discovery of many novel organisms .

Microscopy revealed the previously unknown world of microorganisms , laying the groundwork for cell theory .

The third set is lost at 9 – 15 years of age , and set four lasts until 18 – 28 years of age . The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s .

This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention , which prohibits its agricultural use . One problem with all forms of IRS is insecticide resistance . Mosquitoes affected by IRS tend to rest and live indoors , and due to the irritation caused by spraying , their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors , meaning that they are less affected by the IRS ."

A 1998 study by Gary Nunn and Scott Stanley showed that the fulmarine petrels were indeed a discrete group within the family , as were the gadfly petrels in the genus Pterodroma . However the two petrels in the genus Bulweria are no longer considered close to the gadfly petrels , instead being moved closer to the shearwaters in the genus Procellaria . Two genera , Pseudobulweria and Lugensa , have been split from the gadfly petrel genus Pterodroma , with Pseudobulweria being phylogenetically closer to the Puffinus shearwaters than the Pterodroma gadfly petrels , and Lugensa ( the Kerguelen petrel ) possibly being closely related to the shearwaters or the fulmars . The prions , according to Nunn and Stanley , were among the larger shearwater group . The Calonectris shearwaters were placed close to the two Puffinus clades ( closer to the Puffinus , or small , clade ) and both were distant to the Procellaria shearwaters . The relationships between the genera and within the genera are still the subject of debate , with researchers lumping and splitting the species and genera within the family and arguing about the position of the genera within the family . Many of the confusing species are among the least known of all seabirds ; some of them ( like the Fiji petrel ) have not been seen more than 10 times since their discovery by science , and others ' breeding grounds are unknown ( like the Heinroth 's shearwater ) ."

In the words of the Victorian author George Trevelyan , the King was determined \" never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans , and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal . \" The King wanted to \" keep the rebels harassed , anxious , and poor , until the day when , by a natural and inevitable process , discontent and disappointment were converted into penitence and remorse \" . However , more recent historians defend George by saying in the context of the times no king would willingly surrender such a large territory , and his conduct was far less ruthless than contemporary monarchs in Europe . After Saratoga , both Parliament and the British people were in favour of the war ; recruitment ran at high levels and although political opponents were vocal , they remained a small minority . With the setbacks in America , Prime Minister Lord North asked to transfer power to Lord Chatham , whom he thought more capable , but George refused to do so ; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North 's administration , but Chatham refused to cooperate . He died later in the same year . In early 1778 , France ( Britain 's chief rival ) signed a treaty of alliance with the United States and the conflict escalated . The United States and France were soon joined by Spain and the Dutch Republic , while Britain had no major allies of its own . Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth both resigned from the government .

The British actively recruited in New York and New Jersey to build regiments of provincial militia , with some success . Loyalists in these areas may have been motivated by seeing elements of the rebel army head home after their enlistments ended . One New York Patriot militia leader wrote that thirty of his men , rather than reenlisting with him , had instead signed up with the enemy . On November 30 Admiral Howe offered amnesty to anyone that had taken up arms against the Crown , provided they swore an oath to it . Washington responded with his own proclamation suggesting that those who did not renounce such oaths should immediately go behind British lines .

The simplicity and low cost of this procedure drove much business to the King 's Bench , which had a negative impact on the Court of Common Pleas and Court of Chancery . Historically , cases now covered by the Bill of Middlesex had been handled by the Common Pleas , using a specialist writ drafted by the Chancery . This writ was very expensive , and as such brought large amounts of revenue to the Chancery and the Common Pleas . Costs varied depending on the amount of money being claimed from the defendant ; it was 6 shillings and 8 pence to claim £ 40 , 10 shillings for £ 100 , and £ 5 for £ 1 @,@ 000 . In return , the Chancery began to bring injunctions against those who claimed Bills of Middlesex , \" whereby [ the judges ] are hindered of their fine which should have been paid in [ the Chancery ] upon the original of the said case \" . These injunctions were only temporary ; \" once the fine had been paid there was nothing to prevent a continuation of proceedings in King ’ s Bench \" .

Romero completed a draft in October 1994 , cowritten with Alan Ormsby and John Sayles , that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep , an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II . Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times , events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high @-@ tech forensic archaeology lab . The script then progresses to a fish @-@ out @-@ of @-@ water story when Imhotep , having regained his youthful appearance , recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from . Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities , Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis . Summoning mystical powers through incantation , Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis , a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master 's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum . After escaping into the city sewer system , Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb . Romero 's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio , who wanted a more accessible picture . Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM , and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers ."

One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol , which modulates bilayer permeability , mechanical strength , and biochemical interactions ."

This new variation of the Genesis included a code known as the Trademark Security System ( TMSS ) , which , when a game cartridge was inserted , would check for the presence of the string \" SEGA \" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge . If the string was present , the console would run the game , and would briefly display the message : \" Produced by or under license from Sega Enterprises , Ltd . \" This system had a twofold effect : it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy , and forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up , making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed . Accolade learned of this development at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1991 , where Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an Ishido game cartridge .

Some intensification was projected , though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures .

The storm initially moved very little , and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location . Later in the day , several different track forecasts arose . One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into Mexico . Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana . At the time , it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center , but rather to the north and east . Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east – west orientation across the southeast United States , Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline , and struck near Freeport , Texas with 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) winds . Inland , the storm rapidly weakened , and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on June 6 . Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression , surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center , which had reformed closer to the deep convection ."

Their ship , the Narada , is purely practical with visible mechanics as it is a \" working ship \" , unlike the Enterprise crew who give a respectable presentation on behalf of the Federation . Chambliss was heavily influenced by the architecture of Antoni Gaudí for the Narada , who created buildings that appeared to be inside out : by making the ship 's exposed wires appear like bones or ligaments , it would create a foreboding atmosphere . The ship 's interior was made of six pieces that could be rearranged to create a different room . The Romulan actors had three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads , while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his character 's head . The film 's Romulans lacked the ' V ' -shaped ridges on the foreheads , which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series . Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero 's crew ritually scar themselves too , forming keloids reminiscent of the ' V ' -ridges . It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough .

    "text": "There is also a debate in the linguistic literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation . This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root can be incorporated into almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning . On the other hand , Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots . The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs . Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation . Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses . This argument is supported by the fact that many of the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation . They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb , subject and object . Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized . Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs . This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element . The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots ."

Realizing this , they adjusted their approach to claim that Democrats would lower the country 's protective tariff , which would allow cheaper manufactured goods to be imported from Europe , and thereby put thousands out of work . This argument struck home in the swing states of New York and Indiana , where many were employed in manufacturing . Hancock did not help his own cause when , in an attempt to remain neutral on the tariff , he said that \" [ t ] he tariff question is a local question \" , which only served to make him appear uninformed about an important issue .

At that time , Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden , which included also bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little . Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement . They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore , whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star @-@ Club in Hamburg , Germany . Blackmore had been a member of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat , pop and rock acts , including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages , where he had met Little . Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg , where he was hanging out in local clubs . The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967 . Meanwhile , Curtis ' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development , forcing his financiers , HEC Enterprises , to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of filling out the rest of the band ."

If the pilot had been forced to fly manually from Medellín , investigators believed this might have added to exhaustion and stress in the cockpit . For evidence , the NTSB pointed to nine instances where the captain asked the copilot to repeat the ATC instructions or to confirm the aircraft configuration .

The CFCF , in communication with NY TRACON , established an airport acceptance rate of 28 aircraft landings per hour that morning . Later , a CFCF supervisor contacted NY TRACON and requested a higher rate of 33 landings per hour . This acceptance rate , investigators concluded , was based on inaccurate weather conditions .

A year later Magnús succeeded to the kingship , as the chronicle records that he returned to Mann and , with the consent of the people , began his reign . There are indications that opposition to Magnús , and thus possibly support of Haraldr , continued into the mid 1250s . For example , the chronicle records that when Hákon bestowed upon Magnús the title of king in 1254 , it further notes that when Magnús ' opponents heard of this , they became dismayed and that their hopes of overthrowing him gradually faded away . Furthermore , a letter of protection , written on behalf of Henry to Magnús in 1256 , orders Henry 's men not to receive Haraldr and Ívarr , which may thus indicate that these two men were still alive and active .

Thanks to Demosthenes ' diplomatic manoeuvres , Abydos also entered into an alliance with Athens . These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes . The Assembly , however , laid aside Philip 's grievances against Demosthenes ' conduct and denounced the peace treaty ; so doing , in effect , amounted to an official declaration of war . In 339 BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece , assisted by Aeschines ' stance in the Amphictyonic Council . During a meeting of the Council , Philip accused the Amfissian Locrians of intruding on consecrated ground . The presiding officer of the Council , a Thessalian named Cottyphus , proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians . Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress . Demosthenes however reversed Aeschines ' initiatives and Athens finally abstained . After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians , the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gave command of the league 's forces to Philip and asked him to lead a second excursion . Philip decided to act at once ; in the winter of 339 – 338 BC , he passed through Thermopylae , entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians . After this significant victory , Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338 BC . He then turned south @-@ east down the Cephissus valley , seized Elateia , and restored the fortifications of the city ."

Luda declared that the \" element ugg \" was used generically in the sheepskin boot market but that its use had not caused any confusion with Luda 's UGG AUSTRALIA products . Luda began manufacturing ugg boots in 1981 and in 1982 began selling its boots with woven heel counters featuring the UGG AUSTRALIA mark . In 1984 , the company was incorporated at which time Luda had attempted to trademark its UGG AUSTRALIA logo but was asked by the Trade Mark Office not to proceed as the name was \" descriptive \" and was therefore not registerable . In 2004 , Luda filed another trademark application after becoming aware of \" other products being sold bearing variations of the element UGG \" in conjunction with the word \" Australia . \" Deckers opposed the application on three grounds , prior use ( Deckers argued that the prior use shown by Luda was invalid as the mark they sought to register was not \" an exact copy \" of the mark they used ) , that Deckers had a more significant reputation in Australia and that Luda had filed the application in bad faith . The court found that Deckers did not have a significant reputation in an Australian market which was dominated by Luda Productions , and thus failed the requirements of the Trade Practices Act , regarding public misapprehension of the origin of the manufacturer . The court noted that Luda 's use of the term \" UGG AUSTRALIA \" predated Deckers ' infringement defense by 22 years , which negated Deckers ' claim that Luda was trading upon their reputation and that Luda had not filed in bad faith , but in order to gain statutory protection for trade marks already recognized in Australia .

His works on the subject , The History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic ( 1837 ) , The History of the Conquest of Mexico ( 1843 ) , A History of the Conquest of Peru ( 1847 ) and the unfinished History of the Reign of Phillip II ( 1856 – 1858 ) have become classic works in the field , and have had a great impact on the study of both Spain and Mesoamerica . During his lifetime , he was upheld as one of the greatest living American intellectuals , and knew personally many of the leading political figures of the day , in both the United States and Britain . Prescott has become one of the most widely translated American historians , and was an important figure in the development of history as a rigorous academic discipline . Historians admire Prescott for his exhaustive , careful , and systematic use of archives , his accurate recreation of sequences of events , his balanced judgments and his lively writing style . He was primarily focused on political and military affairs , largely ignoring economic , social , intellectual , and cultural forces that in recent decades historians have focused on . Instead , he wrote narrative history , subsuming unstated causal forces in his driving storyline ."

The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color , and a green color in the Mandelin test . Neither of these tests , however , is specific for psilocybin ; for example , the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs , such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings , including amphetamine and methamphetamine . Ehrlich 's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography . Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples . Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography , the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs . In forensic toxicology , techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( GC – MS ) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures . These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry , capillary zone electrophoresis , ultraviolet spectroscopy , and infrared spectroscopy . High performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) is used with ultraviolet , fluorescence , electrochemical , and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods ."

The present location of this initial specimen is uncertain ; reportedly stored at the Hudson Bay Museum , it could not be located in 1915 .

In 1810 John Blenkinsop , Brandling 's agent at Middleton , was looking for cheaper ways of moving coal to Leeds . He designed the rack railway and Matthew Murray built the first Middleton Railway locomotive , \" Salamanca \" , at his Round Foundry in Holbeck .

They designed Roy by taking a clone of a pre @-@ existing character and changing the clone into the desired result , along with using the same use of the engine to make the character Mewtwo but with major edits to its model ( due to it and Lucario having different movesets ) . The designers explained that they would not use this to make characters such as those who first appear in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in order to avoid cease @-@ and @-@ desist letters from Nintendo . The designers added new alternate costumes for a number of characters , including Dr. Mario , who was previously cut from Brawl , for Mario . It was given a release date of December 9 , 2013 , and a final character count of 41 ( more than any previous Super Smash Bros. game at the time ) . Senior designer Corey Archer stated that there would probably be only one more update before he considers Project M complete ; he suggested that this update may contain new Nintendo characters ."

    "text": "Parthian history can also be reconstructed via the Chinese historical records of events . In contrast to Greek and Roman histories , the early Chinese histories maintained a more neutral view when describing Parthia , although the habit of Chinese chroniclers to copy material for their accounts from older works ( of undetermined origin ) makes it difficult to establish a chronological order of events . The Chinese called Parthia Ānxī ( Chinese : 安息 ) , perhaps after the Greek name for the Parthian city Antiochia in Margiana ( Greek : Αντιόχεια της Μαργιανήs ) . However , this could also have been a transliteration of \" Arsaces \" , after the dynasty 's eponymous founder . The works and historical authors include the Shiji ( also known as the Records of the Grand Historian ) by Sima Qian , the Han shu ( Book of Han ) by Ban Biao , Ban Gu , and Ban Zhao , and the Hou Han shu ( Book of Later Han ) by Fan Ye . They provide information on the nomadic migrations leading up to the early Saka invasion of Parthia and valuable political and geographical information . For example , the Shiji ( ch . 123 ) describes diplomatic exchanges , exotic gifts given by Mithridates II to the Han court , types of agricultural crops grown in Parthia , production of wine using grapes , itinerant merchants , and the size and location of Parthian territory . The Shiji also mentions that the Parthians kept records by \" writing horizontally on strips of leather , \" that is , parchment ."

He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder , with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries . The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men . Johnson 's nerve failed him , as did his command of the techniques that had served him well . O 'Hara describes that he fought \" like a wild man \" and , throwing caution to the wind , broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail and then to the floor . This was the turning point , and O 'Hara describes the situation as , \" Frightfully beaten , his fists useless , his eyes closed , bathed in blood , and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch , he refuses to surrender . \" He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan , which generated much disapprobation among the crowd . Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious . Johnson had lost the fight , and his status as champion , in 21 minutes . Egan speculated that Johnson 's change in style , evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan 's abilities or from his gambling problems ; either way , \" there was a miserable falling off in him altogether ! \""

One difference between NHL and IIHF rules is rink dimensions : the NHL rink is narrower , measuring 61x26 metres ( 200x85 feet ) , instead of the international size of 61x30 metres ( 200x98.5 feet ) . Another rule difference between the NHL and the IIHF rules concerns how icings are called . As of the 2013 @-@ 14 regular NHL season , a linesman stops play due to icing using the hybrid icing method , instead of the former method , where a defending player ( other than the goaltender ) touched the puck before an attacking player was able to , in contrast to the IIHF rules that use \" no @-@ touch \" icing , where play is stopped the moment the puck crosses the goal line . The NHL and IIHF differ also in penalty rules .

John married Isabella whilst she was relatively young – her exact date of birth is uncertain , and estimates place her between at most 15 and more probably towards nine years old at the time of her marriage . Even by the standards of the time , Isabella was married whilst very young . John did not provide a great deal of money for his wife 's household and did not pass on much of the revenue from her lands , to the extent that historian Nicholas Vincent has described him as being \" downright mean \" towards Isabella . Vincent concluded that the marriage was not a particularly \" amicable \" one . Other aspects of their marriage suggest a closer , more positive relationship .

Rachel Talalay 's stepdaughter gave her a Tank Girl comic to read while she was shooting her directorial debut film , Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare ( released in 1991 ) . Talalay read the comic between takes and became interested in directing a Tank Girl film . She contacted Astor and , after hearing nothing for almost a year , was about to give up trying to secure the rights when he gave her permission to make the film . Talalay pitched the film to Amblin Entertainment and Columbia Pictures , who both turned it down . Talalay turned down an offer from Disney as she did not believe the studio would allow the levels of violence and the sexual references the plot required . An offer from MGM was accepted . Talalay worked closely with the Tank Girl comic 's co @-@ creators Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett during the film 's production , and selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer . The studio was unhappy with Hardwicke , who was relatively unknown at the time , being chosen over more experienced designers and Talalay had to meet with the producers to persuade them to allow Hardwicke to work on the project . Tedi Sarafian wrote the screenplay , which marked his debut production credit , and Gale Tattersall was chosen as cinematographer . Believing that MGM would not allow the depiction of a bestial relationship in the film , the romance between Tank Girl and Booga was only written into the second or third version of the script , after the character was already established in the minds of people involved in the production .

Suitable breeding sites include small fish @-@ free ponds , marshes , shallow lakes and other still @-@ water wetlands . Like other ambystomatid salamanders , they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position .

The courtship dance for the long @-@ toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A. jeffersonianum . In the long @-@ toed salamander , there is no rubbing or head @-@ butting ; the males directly approach females and grab on , while the females try to rapidly swim away . The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake , a behavior called amplexus . Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well .

The female struggles but later becomes subdued . Males increase the tempo and motions , rubbing over the female 's nostrils , sides , and sometimes the vent . When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head , raised , and waving at the tip . If the female accepts the males courtship , the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations . As the female follows , the male stops and deposits a spermatophore , and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet . The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt . Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating ."

He explained chemical processes in the body in terms of addition and subtraction of simple molecules from a larger organic molecule , a concept that Bird followed in his own work . But even the materialistic Liebig continued to invoke the vital force for processes inside living animal bodies . This seems to have been based on a belief that the entire living animal is required for these chemical processes to take place . Bird helped to dispel this kind of thinking by showing that specific chemistry is related to specific organs in the body rather than to the whole animal . He challenged some of Liebig 's conclusions concerning animal chemistry . For example , Liebig had predicted that the ratio of uric acid to urea would depend on the level of activity of a species or individual ; Bird showed this to be false . Bird also felt that it was not enough simply to count atoms as Liebig did , but that an explanation was also required as to why the atoms recombined in one particular way rather than any other .

The second half of the film was shot first , and the crew moved to Los Angeles to film the first half . New Line Cinema and Sega of America established a financial relationship in which a Sega Game Gear video game would be developed for the film . Game designers began developing the video game Surf Ninjas when the film was only in its scripting phase , receiving creative input from director Neal Israel . In turn , Sega partially financed the film . Screenwriter Dan Gordon said that he wrote action sequences that would both suit the film and serve as a springboard for the video game .

One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power , maneuverability , speed , and stamina over Inca warriors . All Spaniards wore some kind of armor , the most commonly used types were chain mail shirts and padded cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits ; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields . The main Spanish offensive weapon was the steel sword , which horsemen supplemented with the lance ; both weapons could easily penetrate the padded armor worn by Inca troops . Firearms , such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce , hard to use , and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon . Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies . These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts .

This species is caught infrequently on longlines and in gillnets , and is used for meat and fins . As a predator , though , the shark can accumulate ciguatera toxins produced by dinoflagellates within its tissues . In November 1993 , some 500 people in Manakara , Madagascar , were poisoned , 98 of them fatally , after eating meat from a pigeye shark . This was the first recorded mass ciguatera outbreak caused by a shark , as well as the first with a significant death toll .

A study by Youth Music found that 2 @.@ 5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as Guitar Hero . The group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs . Guitar teachers in the US have reported an increase in students who cite Guitar Hero as their inspiration to start learning . On the other hand , industry professionals , such the inventor of the Fretlight practice tool , have expressed scepticism over the game 's educational value . There is anecdotal evidence that Guitar Hero aids rhythm and general hand @-@ coordination , but also that it creates a false preconception of the difficulty of learning guitar , which can lead students to discontinue their studies . Guitar Center conducted a survey which found that a majority of instrument @-@ based rhythm gamers intended to take up a real instrument in the future while a majority of those who were already musicians had been inspired to play their instruments more . Despite such popularity the guitar remains less popular than it was in the 1960s . Some musicians have been critical of Guitar Hero 's impact on music education . Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works , while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts . Similarly , Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the Guitar Hero series , stating that he felt that it was \" more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar \" . Other commentators have pointed to drum controllers ( including the expanded , lifelike Drum Rocker kit ) used in such games as potentially useful in learning and creating music with real drums ."

The film is also one of the few Hollywood motion pictures to depict a lesbian as feminine and not predatory . Theodora 's lesbianism helps to create conflict in the picture . Had Theodora been heterosexual , Eleanor 's growing attraction to Markway would not have threatened her . But with Theodora a clear lesbian , Markway becomes a threat that causes conflict between the psychic and the investigator . Originally , Gidding 's script had contained a scene early in the film in which Theodora is shown in her apartment in the city . It is clear from the context that she has just broken off with her female lover : \" I hate you \" is written on the mirror in lipstick . Theodora is yelling curses at her out the window and more . However , Wise decided to cut the scene , believing it to be too explicit for a film that worked hard to make things implicit . According to Harris , film censors demanded that Theo never be shown to touch Eleanor , in order to keep the lesbianism less obvious ."

Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition – at that time , Indians were not U.S. citizens and according to Matthews did not have a \" voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws . \" The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty , and is still valid law . For example , United States v. Lara , ( 2004 ) cited Crow Dog when holding that both a tribe and the federal government could prosecute Lara , as they were separate sovereigns .

Under the outer bark , orange and brown patches of necrosis spread out from leaf nodes until they encircle the stem , which then dies . Flower spikes may be affected during flowering season . In humid spells during warm weather , white or pink spore tendrils are produced on dead wood . One affected stand monitored over three years from October 1989 to June 1992 showed a 97 % mortality of plants ( compared with a baseline 40 % ) . Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma , however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant .

The resulting website , www.saveiantojones.com , has organised a protest which encourages fans to send coffee , along with postcards and letters of complaint , to the BBC , a reference to Ianto 's status as the \" coffee boy \" . Via the Save Ianto Jones website , fans are also campaigning to raise money for the BBC charity Children in Need in honour of the character . The fundraising site states that \" Though we , his devoted fans , still hope that he 'll come back ... we mourn him . In the series , he died saving the children of Earth ; so it seems fitting to honour his memory by helping the Children in Need . \" Torchwood Magazine reported that the site had raised nearly £ 4 @,@ 000 , with individual donations ranging from £ 2 to £ 50 .

It transports him to prehistoric times where he realizes he must be careful because if he affects anything in the past , it could change the future .

The viceroy has subspecies with somewhat different coloration , each closely matching the local Danaus species . For example , in Florida , the pairing is of the viceroy and the queen butterfly , whereas in Mexico the viceroy resembles the soldier butterfly . The viceroy is thus involved in three different Müllerian pairs . This example was long believed to be Batesian , with the viceroy mimicking the monarch , but the viceroy is actually the more unpalatable species . The genus Morpho is palatable , but some species ( such as M. amathonte ) are strong fliers ; birds – even species that specialize in catching butterflies on the wing – find it hard to catch them . The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most Morpho species may be Müllerian , or may be \" pursuit aposematism \" . The \" orange complex \" of distasteful butterfly species includes the heliconiines Agraulis vanillae , Dryadula phaetusa , and Dryas iulia . At least seven species of millipedes in the genera Apheloria and Brachoria ( Xystodesmidae ) form a Müllerian mimicry ring in the eastern United States , in which unrelated polymorphic species converge on similar color patterns where their range overlaps ."

On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other . Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth 's rotation about its axis . However , the Earth spins rather like a spinning top . Not only does the Earth rotate , it wobbles . The Earth 's axis takes around 25 @,@ 800 years to complete one full wobble . The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today . Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now . In the case of the Egyptian pyramids , it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban , a faint star in the constellation of Draco . The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time , historically speaking . For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn . In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes ."

A similar influence on him and his fellow Beatles was that era 's girl group sound , as reflected in the band 's choice of cover versions during 1962 – 63 . In 1969 , while producing Billy Preston 's debut album on Apple Records , Harrison worked with Doris Troy in London and signed her to the label as a recording artist , songwriter and producer . Another of his favourite female vocalists was Ronnie Spector – formerly known as Veronica Bennett , lead singer of girl group the Ronettes until 1967 , and latterly married to American producer Phil Spector . After co @-@ producing Harrison 's acclaimed All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970 , following the break @-@ up of the Beatles , Spector was granted an unofficial role as head of A & R for Apple Records , and had previously insisted that his wife record for the label .

By 1855 , his biogeographical observations during his field work in South America and the Malay Archipelago made him confident enough in a branching pattern of evolution to publish a paper stating that every species originated in close proximity to an already existing closely allied species . Like Darwin , it was Wallace 's consideration of how the ideas of Malthus might apply to animal populations that led him to conclusions very similar to those reached by Darwin about the role of natural selection . In February 1858 , Wallace , unaware of Darwin 's unpublished ideas , composed his thoughts into an essay and mailed them to Darwin , asking for his opinion . The result was the joint publication in July of an extract from Darwin 's 1844 essay along with Wallace 's letter .

They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales . In line 700 , Gawain is said to pass the \" Holy Head \" , believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford . Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred . As the story goes , Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances . Her uncle , another saint , put her head back in place and healed the wound , leaving only a white scar . The parallels between this story and Gawain 's make this area a likely candidate for the journey ."

Followers of Marx have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx 's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world . The legacy of Marx 's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies , each of which sees itself as Marx 's most accurate interpreter . In the political realm , these tendencies include Leninism , Marxism – Leninism , Trotskyism , Maoism , Luxemburgism , and libertarian Marxism . Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism , often under influence of other views , resulting in structuralist Marxism , historical Marxism , phenomenological Marxism , Analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism ."

Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti 's travels : \" They [ people of Sumatra ] have a green fruit which they call durian , as big as a watermelon . Inside there are five things like elongated oranges , and resembling thick butter , with a combination of flavours . \" The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563 . In 1741 , Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published , providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century . The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius . During the early stages of its taxonomical study , there was some confusion between durian and the soursop ( Annona muricata ) , for both of these species had thorny green fruit . It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda , meaning Dutch durian . In the 18th century , Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut ."

The insects eaten are mostly small flies , aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants . A wide range of other insects are caught , including Lepidoptera , beetles and lacewings . The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground . These martins are gregarious , feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts , or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows . In the case of at least the common house martin , the start of egg laying appears to be linked to the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids , which provide a stable and abundant food supply ."

Modernismo , as Andrade depicted it , was formally tied to the innovations of recent European literature and based on the productive meeting of cultural forces in Brazil 's diverse population ; but it was fiercely nationalistic , based in large part on distinguishing Brazil 's culture from the world and on documenting the damage caused by the lingering effects of colonial rule . At the same time , the complex inner life of its hero suggests themes little explored in earlier Brazilian literature , which critics have taken to refer back to Andrade himself . While Macunaíma is not autobiographical in the strict sense , it clearly reflects and refracts Andrade 's own life . Andrade was a mulatto ; his parents were landowners but were in no sense a part of Brazil 's Portuguese pseudo @-@ aristocracy . Some critics have paralleled Andrade 's race and family background to the interaction between categories of his character Macunaíma .

Ian Hamilton adheres to this view , arguing that while Salinger 's early stories for the \" slicks \" boasted \" tight , energetic \" dialogue , they had also been formulaic and sentimental . It took the standards of The New Yorker editors , among them William Shawn , to refine his writing into the \" spare , teasingly mysterious , withheld \" qualities of \" A Perfect Day for Bananafish \" ( 1948 ) , The Catcher in the Rye , and his stories of the early 1950s . By the late 1950s , as Salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study , Hamilton notes that his stories became longer , less plot @-@ driven , and increasingly filled with digression and parenthetical remarks . Louis Menand agrees , writing in The New Yorker that Salinger \" stopped writing stories , in the conventional sense ...

Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer @-@ selective carrier would need to be developed and it was not until the 1970s that monoclonal antibodies became available for this purpose . Unlike iodine , astatine shows a tendency to dehalogenate from molecular carriers such as these , particularly at sp3 carbon sites ( less so from sp2 sites ) . Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body , this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its host molecule . While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy , more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine . Mitigating the effects of astatine induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development .

Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign . When Congress returned in December , Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln 's policies , calling them \" flagrant usurpations , deserving the condemnation of the community \" . Stevens generally opposed Lincoln 's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad , though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons .

Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) is the most commonly used surgical treatment , developed in the 1980s by Alim @-@ Louis Benabid and others .

Charters from the 1200s suggest that Bromborough ( a town on the Wirral Peninsula ) was originally named Brunanburh ( which could mean \" Bruna 's fort \" ) . In his essay \" The Place @-@ Name Debate \" , Paul Cavill listed the steps by which this transition may have occurred . Evidence suggests that there were Scandinavian settlements in the area starting in the late 800s , and the town is also situated near the River Mersey , which was a commonly used route by Vikings sailing from Ireland . Additionally , the Chronicle states that the invaders escaped at Dingesmere , and Dingesmere could be interpreted as \" mere of the Thing \" . The word Thing ( or þing , in Old Norse ) might be a reference to the Viking Thing ( or assembly ) at Thingwall on the Wirral . In Old English , mere refers to a body of water , although the specific type of body varies depending on the context . In some cases , it refers to a wetland , and a large wetland is present in the area . Therefore , in their article \" Revisiting Dingesmere \" , Cavill , Harding , and Jesch propose that Dingesmere is a reference to a marshland or wetland near the Viking Thing at Thingwall on the Wirral Peninsula . Since the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle describes the battle as taking place \" ymbe Brunanburh \" ( \" around Brunanburh \" ) , numerous locations near Bromborough have been proposed , including the Brackenwood Golf Course in Bebington , Wirral ( formerly within the Bromborough parish ) ."

It has a churrigueresque altarpiece which , due to the lack of columns , most likely dates from the 18th century . The altar is framed with molding — instead of columns — and a painting of the Immaculate Conception presides over it . The altar is surrounded by paintings by José de Ibarra relating to the Passion of Christ and various saints . The chapel also contains a canvas of Saint Christopher painted by Simon Pereyns in 1588 , and the Flagellation by Baltasar de Echave Orio , painted in 1618 . The altarpiece on the right side is also dedicated to the Immaculate Conception and was donated by the College of Saints Peter and Paul . This chapel holds the remains of Franciscan friar Antonio Margil de Jesús who was evangelized in what is now the north of Mexico ."

The loss of financial backing and difficulty in levying taxes after the fire meant that a water park could not be built on the property . From 1897 until the 1930s the park housed an impressive conservatory and ornate sunken garden designed by D. H. Burnham & Co. at 56th Street and Cottage Grove . The Washington Park Conservatory , like those of other city parks such as Humboldt and Douglas Parks , was torn down in the 1930s due to limited resources as a result of the Great Depression . This left Lincoln Park and Garfield Park as Chicago 's main Conservatories . One of the earliest improvements was the \" South Open Green , \" a pastoral meadow with grazing sheep , also used as a ball field . Architect Daniel H.

The remainder of the story focuses on Horus , the product of the union of Isis and Osiris , who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set 's rival for the throne . Their often violent conflict ends with Horus 's triumph , which restores order to Egypt after Set 's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris 's resurrection . The myth , with its complex symbolism , is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession , conflict between order and disorder , and especially death and the afterlife .

They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land , helping to offset the problems of extreme weather conditions . In this era , a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged as the dominant form as Scottish society was largely divided between a few large estate holders and a large number of workers . This had a major impact on the landscape as feudal systems of ownership were abandoned and land holdings reorganised . This process also facilitated the Scottish Agricultural Revolution that further changed the Scottish landscape from the first half of the eighteenth century . This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields , carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads ."

A relatively high level of acquittal in Scottish trials may have been due to the employment of defence lawyers in Scottish courts , a benefit not given accused witches in England . The close involvement of the Scottish Kirk in trials and the decentralised nature of Scottish courts , where local magistrates heard many cases ( in contrast to England where most were before a small number of circuit judges ) , may have contributed to higher rates of prosecution . The diabolic pact is often stated as a major difference between Scottish and English witchcraft cases , but Stuart Maxwell argues that the iconography of Satan may be an imposition of central government beliefs on local traditions , particularly those concerned with fairies , which were more persistent in Scotland than in England .

While gluons are inherently massless , they possess energy – more specifically , quantum chromodynamics binding energy ( QCBE ) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron ( see mass in special relativity ) .

However , in the winter of 1849 – 1850 , a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by August Willich and Karl Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising . Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising , the entire working class from across Europe would rise \" spontaneously \" to join it , thus , creating revolution across Europe . Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was \" adventuristic \" and would be suicide for the Communist League . Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper / Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe . This , Marx maintained , would spell doom for the Communist League itself . Changes in society , Marx argued , are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of \" a handful of men \" . Instead , they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development . In the present stage of development ( circa 1850 ) , following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 , Marx felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms , such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal ( male ) suffrage . In other words , the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution ."

    "text": "In a socioevolutionary approach , Durkheim described the evolution of societies from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity ( one rising from mutual need ) . As the societies become more complex , evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity , the division of labour is counteracting and replacing collective consciousness . In the simpler societies , people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions ; in the larger , modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern , highly complex society to survive . In mechanical solidarity , people are self @-@ sufficient , there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together . Also , in such societies , people have much fewer options in life . In organic solidarity , people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive . Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density , second on increasing \" morality density \" ( development of more complex social interactions ) and thirdly , on the increasing specialisation in workplace . One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law : in mechanical society the law is focused on its punitive aspect , and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community , often by making the punishment public and extreme ; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community ."

In hopes of getting the group signed to the local upstart Motown label , in 1960 Ross asked an old neighbor , Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson , to help the group land an audition for Motown executive Berry Gordy , who had already proven himself a capable songwriter . Robinson liked \" the girls \" ( as they were then known around Motown ) and agreed to help , but he liked their guitarist even more ; with the Primettes ' permission he hired Tarplin , who became the guitarist for the Miracles . Robinson arranged for the Primettes to audition a cappella for Gordy — but Gordy , feeling the girls too young and inexperienced to be recording artists , encouraged them to return when they had graduated from high school . Undaunted , later that year the Primettes recorded a single for Lu Pine Records , a label created just for them , titled \" Tears of Sorrow \" , which was backed with \" Pretty Baby \" . The single failed to find an audience , however . Shortly thereafter , McGlown became engaged and left the group . Local girl Barbara Martin was McGlown 's prompt replacement ."

Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death . In the 1960s Whorf 's views fell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences . Critics argued that Whorf 's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data . In the late 20th century , interest in Whorf 's ideas experienced a resurgence , and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf 's works , arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf 's actual ideas , or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed . The field of linguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in psycholinguistics and linguistic anthropology , and continues to generate debate and controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism . By comparison Whorf 's other work in linguistics , the development of such concepts as the allophone and the cryptotype , and the formulation of \" Whorf 's law \" in Uto @-@ Aztecan historical linguistics , have met with broad acceptance ."

The film likely had a wide release like other Thanhouser releases . Known advertisements by theaters include those in Minnesota , Kansas , and Indiana . The film received mainly positive reviews from trade publications including The New York Dramatic Mirror which stated , \" Although the story of the film does not promise a great deal , the scenes are developed with enough care for details to carry it easily . More is due to the stage management in this case than to the author . A chauffeur , dismissed for no reason by his employer , is down and out . Resorting to beggary , he is kindly treated by a little girl whom he later repays by rescuing her from two abductors . The grateful parents immediately give him a new chance at which he doubtless makes good . Except for the point where the beggar overhears the accomplices , the acting is good . The impossible parts of the plot are gracefully omitted - the abduction itself , and the overpowering of the chauffeur who was in the plot . In the last scene it is noted that the occupants of the automobile all disembark into the middle of the street instead of upon the sidewalk . Doubtless their excitement excuses their indiscretion . \" This review serves to highlight the actual action of the lost film and some of the execution of the scenes .

The most radical preachers thought that bishops , if needed at all , should be \" unlorded \" . This attitude was attractive to Dudley , as it conveniently allowed him to fill up the Exchequer or distribute rewards with Church property . When new bishops were appointed — typically to the sees of deprived conservative incumbents — they often had to surrender substantial land holdings to the Crown and were left with a much reduced income . The dire situation of the Crown finances made the Council resort to a further wave of Church expropriation in 1552 – 1553 , targeting chantry lands and Church plate . At the time and since , the break @-@ up and reorganisation of the Prince @-@ Bishopric of Durham has been interpreted as Dudley 's attempt to create himself a county palatine of his own .

Overall , Northumberland 's provisions for reorganised dioceses reveal a concern in him that \" the preaching of the gospel \" should not lack funds .

This six @-@ act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on Broadway to stand on its own , without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece . Most of Aiken 's dialogue is lifted verbatim from Stowe 's novel and it included four full musical numbers written by the producer , George C. Howard . Another legacy of this adaptation is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage . This reliance led to large sets and set a precedent for the future days of film . By focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters , Aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences . By combining this melodramatic approach with the content of Stowe 's novel , Aiken helped to create a powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery ."

To progress through the game the player must alternately navigate the outside world as Lan Hikari and the Net as MegaMan.EXE , each containing certain tasks that must be completed to allow advancement in the other . Controlling Lan , the player may travel around the world map , interact with non @-@ player characters , check email , purchase items , initiate Net missions , or speak with MegaMan.EXE through his PET . In contrast with traditional Mega Man entries in which battle and movement through the levels happen in the same setting , Battle Network 's combat occurs only through by battling computer viruses within the Net . This cyber world is represented by a series of branching pathways and nodes , where MegaMan.EXE can travel to both new and previously visited locations , find and purchase items , and fight viruses . Battles do not generally appear on the field screen of the Net but are usually set as random encounters . The battlefield itself is made up of 18 tiles divided into two groups of nine , one group being space in which MegaMan.EXE may freely move and the other group being space inhabited by enemies . Akin to other Mega Man games , MegaMan.EXE possesses an arm cannon called the \" Mega Buster \" . The player can transition among the nine provided tiles and fire the Mega Buster at enemies from across the screen . The objective of each battle is to delete all the viruses by reducing their hit points ( HP ) to zero . If MegaMan.EXE 's own health depletes , a game over occurs . Certain power @-@ up programs can be found that upgrade MegaMan.EXE 's HP , defense , or Mega Buster power ."

On 28 November , instead of launching another infantry assault , the fort was encircled from all sides and placed under siege . This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering the fort . Mawbey then instructed his gunners , by now strongly reinforced , to fire into the fort . He also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort 's external water source . The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water , stored in a portico , were destroyed in the bombardment . The eastern and northern walls of the fort were razed to the ground . The continuous bombardment also caused three of the four cannons installed on the fort 's battlements to fall outside the fort , while the other fell inside . The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable , having either been disabled by misfiring during previous attacks , or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment . Left without any cannons to reply , the garrison suffered heavy casualties . They continued to resist using gunfire and stones , but eventually the few people that remained in the fort became desperate and could not hold on any longer . That night , despite threats to their person and property , desertion became rampant ."

The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear , but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger 's , held at Exning . Another earl , Waltheof , despite being one of William 's favourites , was also involved , and some Breton lords were ready to offer support . Ralph also requested Danish aid . William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt . Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by Wulfstan , the Bishop of Worcester , and Æthelwig , the Abbot of Evesham . Ralph was bottled up in Norwich Castle by the combined efforts of Odo of Bayeux , Geoffrey of Coutances , Richard fitzGilbert , and William de Warenne . Norwich was besieged and surrendered , and Ralph went into exile . Meanwhile , the Danish king 's brother , Cnut , had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships , but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered . The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home . William did not return to England until later in 1075 , to deal with the Danish threat and the aftermath of the rebellion , celebrating Christmas at Winchester . Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison , where Waltheof was executed in May 1076 . By that time William had returned to the continent , where Ralph was continuing the rebellion from Brittany ."

    "text": "In 1828 , Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island , Telemark county , Norway . He was a Norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist who studied the minerals in Telemark , where he served as vicar . He commonly sent the most interesting specimens , such as this one , to his father , Jens Esmark , a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo . The elder Esmark determined that it was not any known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination . Berzelius determined that it contained a new element . He published his findings in 1829 , having isolated an impure sample for the first time by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal . Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery . Thus , he named the source mineral thorite , which has the chemical composition ( Th , U ) SiO4 . Berzelius also made some initial characterisation of the new metal and its chemical compounds : he correctly determined that the thorium – oxygen mass ratio was 7 @.@ 5 ( its actual value is close to that , ~ 7 @.@ 3 ) , but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent , and as such assumed that the atomic mass was 7 @.@ 5 times that of oxygen ( 120 amu ) , while it is actually 15 times as large . Berzelius , however , did not isolate the element in its metallic state ; for the first time , thorium was isolated in 1914 by D. Lely Jr. and L. Hamburger . They obtained 99 % pure thorium metal by reducing thorium chloride with sodium metal . A simpler method leading to even higher purity was discovered in 1927 by Marden and Rentschler , involving the reduction of thorium oxide with calcium when calcium chloride was present ."

She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 when Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected his surprise night attack on the Russians by his destroyers to be much more successful than it actually was and anticipated that they would be badly disorganized and weakened , but the Russians had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the cruiser Boyarin which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the Russian ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a bad idea as the Japanese 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage of significance on the Russian ships who concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect .

In his book Hereditary Genius , writing before the development of IQ testing , he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong , and that eminence is rare in the general population . Lewis Terman chose \" ' near ' genius or genius \" as the classification label for the highest classification on his 1916 version of the Stanford – Binet test . By 1926 , Terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of California schoolchildren who were referred for IQ testing by their schoolteachers , called Genetic Studies of Genius , which he conducted for the rest of his life . Catherine M. Cox , a colleague of Terman 's , wrote a whole book , The Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses , published as volume 2 of The Genetic Studies of Genius book series , in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses . Although her estimates of childhood IQ scores of historical figures who never took IQ tests have been criticized on methodological grounds , Cox 's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides IQ in becoming a genius . By the 1937 second revision of the Stanford – Binet test , Terman no longer used the term \" genius \" as an IQ classification , nor has any subsequent IQ test . In 1939 , Wechsler specifically commented that \" we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score . \""

From lowest to highest , the atmospheric layers are the troposphere , stratosphere , thermosphere and exosphere . Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients . The lowest layer , the troposphere , has a complicated system of clouds and hazes , comprising layers of ammonia , ammonium hydrosulfide and water . The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter 's surface are organized in a dozen zonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows ( winds ) known as jets . The bands alternate in color : the dark bands are called belts , while light ones are called zones . Zones , which are colder than belts , correspond to upwellings , while belts mark descending air . The zones ' lighter color is believed to result from ammonia ice ; what gives the belts their darker colors is not known with certainty . The origins of the banded structure and jets are not well understood , though two models exist . The shallow model holds that they are surface phenomena overlaying a stable interior .

A strong contingent of women from America joined international women 's groups to change the existing nationality laws , but the women were unable to agree on wording . Intense lobbying by women , and a massive parade demonstration , failed to influence the conferees , and the international law continued to hold that a woman 's nationality followed her husband 's . In response , Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year . Six of the most influential international women 's groups sought a broad base of support from working women . Macmillan 's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention , and to make certain that a woman 's nationality would not change without her consent , and that the nationality of a couple 's children would not be more influenced by the father 's nationality . The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem , but when the League constituted a study group , that group was split between two intractable factions . On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality , based on that of the husband , and on the other side were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses , with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands , and children to be allowed dual citizenship . In 1932 , the women 's group , at an impasse , were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations , who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention . The women 's group disbanded , and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937 ."

As early as the 1850s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution , Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values — what he called the \" sheet anchor \" of republicanism . The Declaration 's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the Constitution 's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate . As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 , \" Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself . \" His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms . Nevertheless , in 1861 , Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms ( the Constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree ) , and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state . Burton ( 2008 ) argues that Lincoln 's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated ."

The airfield was deserted so Frost marched the battalion 10 miles ( 16 km ) to a second airfield at Oudna . Due to postponement of their advance , the First Army did not relieve the battalion as planned and instead it became trapped 50 miles ( 80 km ) behind the German lines , where Frost was informed by radio that they had been written off . After ambushing an advancing German formation , the battalion were attacked by a second German unit and surrounded . On 1 December the Germans attacked with infantry , armour and artillery , almost wiping out ' C ' Company and causing heavy casualties in the rest of the battalion . Frost ordered the battalion to disperse into company groups and head for the Allied lines . On 3 December , the surviving 180 men reached safety at Majaz al Bab . With no more opportunities for parachute operations , the brigade fought in the front line as normal infantry . In February they held the right flank of the Allied line at Bou Arada and on the night of 2 / 3 February , the 1st Battalion , along with a French Foreign Legion unit , captured the Jebel Mansour heights and were then subjected to constant shelling and infantry attacks . After three days without relief , their almost ammunition expended , and having suffered 200 casualties , they were forced to withdraw . This was followed by the brigade fighting two fierce engagements at Tamera and checking the German offensive of Operation Ochsenkopf . When the Allied advance began again after the winter rains , the brigade was assigned to the force tasked with capturing Bizerta on 17 March .

Unlike most other primate species , the mantled guereza can survive habitat degradation and can even thrive in degraded forests . Sometimes , logging may increase the number of preferred food trees for the mantled guereza and it is more abundant in logged areas than unlogged ones . However , complete forest clearance causes dramatic declines in numbers . In Uganda complete forest clearings caused a decline of 50 % over eight years . The mantled guereza is also threatened by hunting for meat and its skin . Mantled guereza meat sells as bushmeat for $ 4 – 9 US . The skins have been sold for fashion or in the tourist trade ."

    "text": "Wallace had once briefly met Darwin , and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories . Although Wallace 's first letter to Darwin has been lost , Wallace carefully kept the letters he received . In the first letter , dated 1 May 1857 , Darwin commented that Wallace 's letter of 10 October which he had recently received , as well as Wallace 's paper \" On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species \" of 1855 , showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions , and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time . The second letter , dated 22 December 1857 , said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution , adding that \" without speculation there is no good and original observation \" while commenting that \" I believe I go much further than you \" . Wallace trusted Darwin 's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay , \" On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type \" , with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile . Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago , the Ternate essay was in a private letter . On 18 June 1858 , Darwin received the essay from Wallace . While Wallace 's essay obviously did not employ Darwin 's term \" natural selection \" , it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures . In this sense , it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years , but had yet to publish . Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \" he could not have made a better short abstract ! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish , but I shall , of course , at once write and offer to send to any journal . \" Distraught about the illness of his baby son , Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker , who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin 's priority . Wallace had not asked for publication of his essay , and indeed , doing so probably contravened the copyright law of the time . Wallace 's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858 , along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857 ."

With these changes , Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion , which increasingly inclined toward fine , detailed works . His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh , and shine becomes almost nonexistent . His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of Titian , and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of ' finish ' and surface quality of paintings . Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt 's brushwork , and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings . The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures , when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting 's surface . The end result is a richly varied handling of paint , deeply layered and often apparently haphazard , which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner ."

It intergrades with B. b. ruthenus in northern Russia around the basin of the upper Mezen River and in the eastern vicinity of Gorki Leninskiye , Tambov and Voronezh , and intergrades with B. b. interpositus in northern Ukraine . This is a medium @-@ sized race , measuring in wing chord length 435 – 480 mm ( 17 @.@ 1 – 18 @.@ 9 in ) in males and 455 – 500 mm ( 17 @.@ 9 – 19 @.@ 7 in ) .

Critics labeled this \" trickle @-@ down economics \" — the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a \" trickle @-@ down \" effect to the poor . Questions arose whether Reagan 's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty , and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles . These views were exacerbated by the fact that Reagan 's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $ 3 @.@ 35 an hour , slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60 % , cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half , and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program . The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan 's economic policies took effect . Along with Reagan 's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income , he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20 % . Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages , with both topping out at 28 % . Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency , all in the name of fiscal responsibility . According to Paul Krugman , \" Over all , the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut ; as a share of GDP , the increase was substantially larger than Mr. Clinton 's 1993 tax increase . \" According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett , Reagan 's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut ."

Horii used bridges to signify changes in difficulty and implemented a level progression with a high starting growth rate that decelerates over time , which contrasted to the random initial stats and constant growth rates of the early editions of Dungeons & Dragons . To make the game appeal to a larger audience , manga artist and creator of Dragon Ball , Akira Toriyama , was hired to produce the artwork .

Most people up to the Late Middle Ages – Renaissance believed Earth to be stationary at the centre of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky . Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos , Nicolaus Copernicus was the first to develop a mathematically predictive heliocentric system . In the 17th century , Galileo Galilei , Johannes Kepler , and Isaac Newton developed an understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that Earth moves around the Sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that governed Earth . The invention of the telescope led to the discovery of further planets and moons .

Their guns were usually of inferior design , and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship . The East Indiamen sought to ensure the safety of their cargo and passengers , not defeat enemy warships in battle . Despite these disadvantages , the size of East Indiamen meant that from a distance they appeared quite similar to a small ship of the line , a deception usually augmented by paintwork and dummy cannon . At the Bali Strait Incident of 28 January 1797 an unescorted convoy of East Indiamen had used this similarity to intimidate a powerful French frigate squadron into withdrawing without a fight .

To eradicate smallpox , each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading , by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by . This process is known as \" ring vaccination \" . The key to this strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community ( known as surveillance ) and containment . The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases , as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities . The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection , and that carriers did not exist , played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox . The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities . Early on , donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States , but by 1973 , more than 80 percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries ."

The attack on Samakh ( Tzemah ) resumed before dawn on May 17 — the Syrians attacked the village 's northern positions , but their armor stayed behind . The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself , despite severe ammunition shortages on the Israeli side ."

Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers , William and Henry , including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert , it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless . Orderic relates that he had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and had been rebuffed . The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men , many of them the sons of William 's supporters . Included among them was Robert of Belleme , William de Breteuil , and Roger , the son of Richard fitzGilbert . This band of young men went to the castle at Remalard , where they proceeded to raid into Normandy . The raiders were supported by many of William 's continental enemies . William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard , but King Philip gave them the castle at Gerberoi , where they were joined by new supporters . William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079 . After three weeks , the besieged forces sallied from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise . William was unhorsed by Robert and was only saved from death by an Englishman . William 's forces were forced to lift the siege , and the king returned to Rouen . By 12 April 1080 , William and Robert had reached an accommodation , with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when he died ."

A total of 120 passengers finally departed on August 5 — 90 on the Mayflower and 30 on the Speedwell . Leaving Southampton , the Speedwell experienced significant leakage , which required the ships to immediately put in at Dartmouth . The leakage was partly caused by being over masted and being pressed too much with sail . Repairs were completed , then a further delay ensued awaiting favorable winds . The two ships finally set sail on August 23 and made it only two hundred miles beyond Land 's End before another major leak in the Speedwell forced the expedition to return again to England , this time to the port of Plymouth . The Speedwell was found to be unseaworthy ; some passengers abandoned their attempt to emigrate , while others joined the Mayflower , crowding the already heavily burdened ship . Later , it was speculated that the crew of the Speedwell had intentionally sabotaged the ship to avoid having to make the treacherous trans @-@ Atlantic voyage . The delays had significant consequences ; the cost of the repairs and port fees required that the colonists sell some of their invaluable provisions , but , more importantly , the delays meant that everyone had to spend the entire winter on board the Mayflower off Cape Cod in what could only be described as squalid conditions ."

    "text": "In the early seventeenth century famine was relatively common , with four periods of famine prices between 1620 and 1625 . The invasions of the 1640s had a profound impact on the Scottish economy , with the destruction of crops and the disruption of markets resulting in some of the most rapid price rises of the century . Under the Commonwealth , the country was relatively highly taxed , but gained access to English markets . After the Restoration the formal frontier with England was re @-@ established , along with its customs duties . Economic conditions were generally favourable from 1660 to 1688 , as land owners promoted better tillage and cattle @-@ raising . The monopoly of royal burghs over foreign trade was partially ended by and Act of 1672 , leaving them with the old luxuries of wines , silk , spices and dyes and opening up trade of increasingly significant salt , coal , corn and hides and imports from the Americas . The English Navigation Acts limited the ability of the Scots to engage in what would have been lucrative trading with England 's growing colonies , but these were often circumvented , with Glasgow becoming an increasingly important commercial centre , opening up trade with the American colonies : importing sugar from the West Indies and tobacco from Virginia and Maryland . Exports across the Atlantic included linen , woollen goods , coal and grindstones . The English protective tariffs on salt and cattle were harder to disregard and probably placed greater limitations on the Scottish economy , despite attempts of the King to have it overturned . However , by the end of the century the drovers roads , stretching down from the Highlands through south @-@ west Scotland to north @-@ east England , had become firmly established . Scottish attempts to counter this with tariffs of their own , were largely unsuccessful as Scotland had relatively few vital exports to protect . Attempts by the Privy Council to build up luxury industries in cloth mills , soap works , sugar boiling houses , gunpowder and paper works , proved largely unsuccessful . The famines of the 1690s were seen as particularly severe , partly because famine had become relatively rare in the second half of the seventeenth century , with only one year of dearth ( in 1674 ) and the shortages of the 1690s would be the last of their kind ."

Du Bois felt that black schools should focus more on liberal arts and academic curriculum ( including the classics , arts , and humanities ) , because liberal arts were required to develop a leadership elite . However , as sociologist E.

Sowell has also argued that , despite genuine disagreements between the two leaders , the supposed animosity between Washington and Du Bois actually formed among their followers , not between Washington and Du Bois themselves . Du Bois himself also made this observation in an interview published in the The Atlantic Monthly in November 1965 ."

    "text": "For instance , Traherne passionately critiques Roman Catholicism in Roman Forgeries ( 1673 ) — the only work published during his lifetime . It is a polemical treatise in the form of a dialogue between two men — a Protestant and a Roman Catholic . Relying on the Scriptures and the pronouncements of the First Council of Nicaea to formulate the idea of a legitimate church authority , Traherne criticises the state of the contemporary Catholic Church and claims through a conspiracy theory that because the Vatican has had control over the manuscripts that the Catholic Church was in a position to corrupt , misuse or suppress documents to support its claim to authority . The abusive nature of the narrator 's critique of the Church of Rome is in sharp contrast to the tenor of Traherne 's poetry or his other writings on theological topics . However , Traherne takes a less polemic tone in the posthumously published Christian Ethicks ( 1675 ) in which he explores theological implications of Calvinist thought on freedom and necessity . In this work , Traherne refuses to define ethics as a secular phenomenon — instead pointing to a firm reliance on the will of God . Because of human limitations and failings , one cannot build a suitable and coherent moral system of beliefs — those virtues must derive from a divine source and their reward from perceiving the infinite love of God at the root of all things ."

His wife Rabodo , who took the throne name Rasoherina , was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally , but rather in concert with the Hova ( the class of free citizens ) as represented by the position of Prime Minister . The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy . However , there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne . A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island ."

This gives Watson some advantages and disadvantages compared with human Jeopardy ! players . Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues . As a result , human players usually generate responses faster than Watson , especially to short clues . Watson 's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response . Watson has consistently better reaction time on the buzzer once it has generated a response , and is immune to human players ' psychological tactics , such as jumping between categories on every clue ."

    "text": "Banksia prionotes × hookeriana has also been verified as occurring in the wild , but only in disturbed locations . The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species ; and though preferring different soils , they often occur near enough to each other for pollinators to move between them . It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons : B. prionotes has usually finished flowering by the end of May , whereas flowering of B. hookeriana usually does not begin until June . In disturbed areas , however , the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available , and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season . Thus the flowering seasons overlap , and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed . The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile , with seed production rates similar to that of the parent species . There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species , and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms . This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity , especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species , such as a wider habitat tolerance . Moreover , speciation might occur if the hybrid 's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents , such as an intermediate soil type ."

Historian David Harris Willson , in his 1956 biography of James , delivered this damning verdict : \" Anne had little influence over her husband . She could not share his intellectual interests , and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women . Alas ! The king had married a stupid wife . \" The 19th century biographer Agnes Strickland condemned Anne 's actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible : \" It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone , both as a woman and queen , that she ... preferred to indulge the mere instincts of maternity at the risk of involving her husband , her infant , and their kingdom , in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare . \""

    "text": "The luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle . During the luteal phase , the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum , which produces progesterone . The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen . The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself . Consequently , the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time , and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies . Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle . From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin , the process typically takes about two weeks , with 14 days considered normal . For an individual woman , the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle ; by contrast , the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle ."

Al @-@ Muwaffaq differed from most Abbasid princes of his time through his close association with and participation in military affairs . In this his career echoes that of his grandfather , the Caliph al @-@ Mu 'tasim ( r . 833 – 842 ) . Like him , al @-@ Muwaffaq 's power relied to a great extent on his close association with the Turkish military : following the demands of the Turkish rank and file for one of the Caliph 's brothers to be appointed as their commander , bypassing their own leaders , who were accused of misappropriating salaries , he was appointed the main intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turkish military . In return for the Turks ' loyalty he abolished the other competing corps of the caliphal army such as the Maghariba or the Faraghina , which are no longer mentioned after ca . 870 . Hugh Kennedy sums up the arrangement thus : \" al @-@ Muwaffaq assured their status and their position as the army of the caliphate and al @-@ Muwaffaq 's role in the civil administration meant that they received their pay \" . Al @-@ Muwaffaq 's close personal relationship with the Turkish military leadership — initially Musa ibn Bugha , as well as Kayghalagh and Ishaq ibn Kundaj after Musa 's death in 877 — his own prestige as a prince of the dynasty , and the exhaustion after a decade of civil strife , allowed him to establish unchallenged control over the Turks , as indicated by their willingness to participate in costly campaigns under his leadership ."

This last specimen , a male , had its testicles located in the scrotum , and therefore was reproductively mature , even though its skull bones were not completely fused , indicating it was not yet osteologically mature . Before it was collected in 2002 , the species was not recorded in earlier biological surveys of Anjozorobe , taking place in 1977 – 1986 and 1996 ; whether this is because the animal is difficult to collect , because its abundance varies from year to year , or because its distribution is patchy is unknown . Goodman and colleagues argued on the basis of this example that rapid surveys may not necessarily yield complete inventories of the fauna of an area . Later surveys in 2005 and 2006 did find it at several other sites in the region , at some of which it was abundant . Anjozorobe is about 450 km ( 280 mi ) from the nearest occurrence of V. gymnocaudus , and most of the intervening area contains montane forest .

Those being hanged had their arms pinioned to their sides with leather straps before being walked to the gallows , where they were placed on a trapdoor and their heads and faces covered with a white cap , or hood . The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor – and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment – and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner 's face . After the noose had been secured around each victim 's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance , the trapdoor was released . The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred , before being lowered to the ground . Calcraft employed the short @-@ drop method of execution , in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) or so . That was often insufficient to break the prisoner 's neck , and therefore death was not always instantaneous , typically occurring slowly by strangulation .

This could indicate that she was the mother of Djedkare 's successor , Unas , or that Djedkare owed the throne to her .

Furthermore , some reliefs showing the queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added above her head .

The horses were reputedly seized from smugglers apprehended in the area , which was notorious for that activity at the time .

Other famous visitors of this era included Lord Nelson — whose sister lived in the nearby village of Handcross — Queen Victoria , who on one occasion was stranded overnight when her carriage broke down , and the Prince Regent , whose patronage of Brighton and regular travelling of the London – Brighton road indirectly brought about the upturn in fortunes experienced by Crawley in general , and the George Hotel in particular , during the 18th century .
