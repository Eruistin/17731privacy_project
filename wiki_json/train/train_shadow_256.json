The debated centered over whether Chinese ritual practices of honoring family ancestors and other formal Confucian and Chinese imperial rites qualified as religious rites and thus incompatible with Catholic belief . The Jesuits argued that these Chinese rites were secular rituals that were compatible with Christianity , within certain limits , and should thus be tolerated .

The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state 's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary 's lands , arguing that the terms of the Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary . In 1813 , the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court 's decision in Fairfax 's Devisee v. Hunter 's Lessee , 11 U.S. 603 , and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute , and remanded the case back to the state supreme court . The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts . The state supreme court 's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court 's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter 's Lessee , 14 U.S. 304 . The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court 's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law .

The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms .

These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller . The concentration is thus able to orbit faster and undergoes less radial drift . Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass . Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids ."

A master 's degree program was authorized in 1929 ; the first such degree granted by ECTC was in 1933 . Progress toward full college status was made in 1948 with the designation of the bachelor of arts as a liberal arts degree , and the bachelor of science as a teaching degree .

    "text": "Sea temperature chiefly depends on the amount of solar radiation it absorbs . In the tropics where sunlight falls more directly , the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) ; near the poles , the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point . Its salinity makes this lower than freshwater 's , usually about − 1 @.@ 8 ° C ( 28 @.@ 8 ° F ) . These temperature differences contribute to the continuous circulation of water through the sea . Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics ; as the water becomes denser , it sinks . The cold water in the deep sea moves back towards the equator before welling up again to the surface . Deep seawater has a temperature between − 2 and 5 ° C ( 28 and 41 ° F ) in all parts of the globe . In freezing seas , ice crystals begin to form on the surface . These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil . In calm conditions , frazil will freeze into a thin , flat sheet called nilas , which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it . In turbulent waters , frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as \" pancakes \" . These slide over and under one another to form floes . During these processes , salt water and air are trapped amid the ice . Nilas forms with a salinity around 12 – 15 ‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time : after a year , it is bluish and closer to 4 – 6 ‰ saline ."

    "text": "The walls , known as Changcheng ( 長城 ) – literally \" long walls \" , but often translated as \" Great Wall \" – were mostly constructed of tamped earth , with some parts built with stones . Where natural barriers like ravines and rivers sufficed for defence , the walls were erected sparingly , but long fortified lines were laid where such advantageous terrains did not exist . Often in addition to the wall , the defensive system included garrisons and beacon towers inside the wall , and watchtowers outside at regular intervals . In terms of defence , the walls were generally effective at countering cavalry shock tactics , but there are doubts as to whether these early walls were actually defensive in nature . Nicola Di Cosmo points out that the northern frontier walls were built far to the north and included traditionally nomadic lands , and so rather than being defensive , the walls indicate the northward expansions of the three northern states and their desire to safeguard their recent territorial acquisitions . This theory is supported by the archeological discovery of nomadic artifacts within the walls , suggesting the presence of pre @-@ existing or conquered barbarian societies . It is entirely possible , as Western scholars like di Cosmo and Lattimore suggest , that nomadic aggression against the Chinese in the coming centuries was partly caused by Chinese expansionism during this period ."

This was largely due to the harsh measures he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire . Conscription was introduced , causing resentment among the peasantry , despite the pressing need for new recruits to the imperial army . In order to restore the imperial treasury , Alexios took measures to tax the aristocracy heavily ; he also cancelled many of the exemptions from taxation that the church had previously enjoyed . In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full , and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation , he completely reformed the coinage , issuing a new gold hyperpyron ( highly refined ) coin for the purpose . By 1109 , he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage . His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years ."

A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram , who has either been chosen by a breeder or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams ( in feral populations ) . Most sheep are seasonal breeders , although some are able to breed year @-@ round . Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months of age , and rams generally at four to six months . However , there are exceptions . For example , Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months , and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months . Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days , during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams . A minority of rams display a preference for homosexuality ( 8 % on average ) and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins ( female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries ) ."

In c . 1801 BC , the powerful kingdom of Elam , which straddled important trade routes across the Zagros Mountains , invaded the Mesopotamian plain . With allies among the plain states , Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Eshnunna , destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time . In order to consolidate its position , Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi 's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of Larsa .

    "text": "Nonmetals have structures in which each atom usually forms ( 8 − N ) bonds with ( 8 − N ) nearest neighbours , where N is the number of valence electrons . Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration . Exceptions to the ( 8 − N ) rule occur with hydrogen ( which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell ) , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen . Atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such that they are able to form alternative ( more stable ) bonding structures , with fewer nearest neighbours . Thus , carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure , and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds , respectively . The larger size of the remaining non @-@ noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms .

Hence , Parliament cannot pass legislation which authorizes the executive to exercise power in breach of these fundamental rules or to exercise power in an arbitrary manner . If the subjective test were to be adopted , it would in effect allow the executive to exercise arbitrary powers of detention , therefore rendering sections 8 and 10 of the ISA inconsistent with Article 12 ( 1 ) . When the case was decided , Article 149 ( 1 ) of the Constitution , which protects the validity of anti @-@ subversion laws notwithstanding inconsistencies with specified fundamental liberties , did not cover inconsistencies with Article 12 . Also , the Court noted that adopting the objective test would be consistent with Article 93 of the Constitution , which vests judicial power in the courts . It did not , however , directly address the argument by counsel that the subjective test , in conferring arbitrary powers of detention , would be inconsistent with Article 93 ."

The behavior of the horizon in this situation is a dissipative system that is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and electrical resistance — the membrane paradigm . This is different from other field theories such as electromagnetism , which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic level , because they are time @-@ reversible . Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters , there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions : the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in . The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon , including approximately conserved quantum numbers such as the total baryon number and lepton number .

According to Hartnady , \" This part of Africa is in the vicinity of the East African Rift system , which is being pulled apart by a few millimetres annually . \" He says \" earthquakes are caused by a slip on a fault line and the release of stored elastic energy \" and mining activity could have triggered the earthquake . Kijko and Hartnady believe that – unlike the 1969 Tulbagh earthquake – this event was a mining @-@ related earthquake which is a relatively more common occurrence than a natural earthquake in South Africa . Professor Ray Durrheim , a seismologist at Wits University , said seismic events will continue while there is mining activity in the area , and even long afterwards .

This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency ( e.g. if cars are more efficient , it will simply lead to more driving ) . Several points have been raised against this argument . First , in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries , the direct rebound effect is usually small , and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use , other conditions remaining constant . Second , even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used , there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency . For example , increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases , shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil . Third , environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention ( e.g. a fuel tax ) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher ."

From the Bronze Age there are examples of carvings , including the first representations of objects , and cup and ring marks . More extensive Scottish examples of patterned objects and gold work are found the Iron Age . Elaborately carved Pictish stones and impressive metalwork emerged in Scotland the early Middle Ages . The development of a common style of Insular art across Great Britain and Ireland influenced elaborate jewellery and illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells . Only isolated examples survive of native artwork from the late Middle Ages and of works created or strongly influenced by artists of Flemish origin . The influence of the Renaissance can be seen in stone carving and painting from the fifteenth century . In the sixteenth century the crown began to employ Flemish court painters who have left a portrait record of royalty . The Reformation removed a major source of patronage for art and limited the level of public display , but may have helped in the growth of secular domestic forms , particularly elaborate painting of roofs and walls . Although the loss of the court as a result of the Union of Crowns in 1603 removed another major source of patronage , the seventeenth century saw the emergence of the first significant native artists for whom names are extant , with figures such as George Jamesone and John Michael Wright ."

A displeased Fingleton was given out by umpire George Borwick and walked off the ground , only to be called back by captain Woodfull . Fingleton refused Woodfull 's offer and did not return until Woodfull successfully asked Borwick to reverse his decision . The media reported that Fingleton had quarrelled with Woodfull and several teammates told him that his apparent rebuff of the national captain would prejudice his chances of selection , and the NSWCA made an inquiry into the matter ; Fingleton failed to respond . During the same innings , Bradman also wrote in his newspaper report that Fingleton had been responsible for the run out of teammate Ray Rowe , which angered Fingleton for an extended period ."

According to biographer Stephen Kelly , Liverpool 's eventual success was based on hard work done in the training system that Shankly , Paisley , Fagan and Bennett introduced at Melwood . Shankly deplored long distance running on roads and insisted that , apart from warm @-@ up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries , the players trained on grass using a ball . Everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups with the purpose of achieving set targets . Five @-@ a @-@ side games , as at all Shankly 's earlier clubs , were at the heart of the system and he insisted on these being as competitive as league matches . One particular routine designed to develop stamina , reflexes and ball skills was the \" sweat box \" which Shankly described as \" using boards like the walls of a house with players playing the ball off one wall and on to the next ; the ball was played against the boards , you controlled it , turned around and took it again \" . Shankly got the idea from a routine he had seen Tom Finney use at Preston to hone his skills . After experimentating with the routine , he set the players a limit of two minutes per session . The system was geared to Shankly 's simple philosophy of \" pass and move \" , which formed the basis of Liverpool 's strategy . Shankly insisted on suitable cooling @-@ off periods after training ( now called \" warming down \" ) before the players took a bath and had a meal . The team changed the studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions . Shankly summarised the entire strategy as : \" attention to detail ; we never left anything to chance \" ."

It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading . It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen , since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast , so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous ."

It is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran ( which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency ) , mannitol , acetic acid and lactic acid . Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process , but usually omitted in Jewish recipes , as chametz ( leavened bread ) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals . Sugar , salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor . After about 2 – 5 days ( or 2 – 3 weeks without the bread ) , the deep red , sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use . It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done , as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate . The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas ( literally ' sour , acid ' ; compare kvass ) and in Yiddish as rosl ( from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water ; compare Russian rassol ' pickle juice ' , Polish rosół ' broth ' ) .

Each raja had dominion over a small area , and each supplied soldiers and annual tribute for the empire 's needs . Soon after the empire 's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family , many chieftains , especially in the west , tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms . Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty , various powers from the north invaded the region intermittently . Among these were the Sultanate of Bijapur to the northwest , the Sultanate of Golconda to the northeast , the fledgling Maratha empire , farther northwest , and the Mughal empire , farther north still . For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers , and amongst the little kings , resulted in shifting sovereignties , loyalties , and borders . By the turn of the 18th century , the political landscape had become better defined . The northwestern hills were being ruled by the Nayaka rulers of Ikkeri , the southwestern , in the Western Ghats , by the Rajas of Coorg , the southern plains by the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore , all of which were Hindu dynasties ; whereas the eastern and northeastern regions were being ruled by the Muslim Nawabs of Arcot and Sira .

Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids ( probably Saurolophus ) , while two have been left by a large theropod ( probably Tarbosaurus ) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod . The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia , which showed a matching hind foot morphology . The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym , making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another , similar titanosaur . The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand . Today only the sand infill remains , with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away ."

This can be shown to be equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances . The image method , therefore , relies on each filter section being terminated with the correct image impedance . This is easy enough to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter , because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances . However , the end sections are a problem . They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency . This mismatch leads to multiple reflections at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections . These reflections result in the filter response deviating quite sharply from the theoretical , especially near the cut @-@ off frequency ."

Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister 's Questions , the first of the post @-@ referendum era . \" When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland . \" Her position remained uncertain . Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership . In October , two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party . McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader , and described the party as \" a political machine that is angry about what has happened in Scotland in the recent past \" . Shortly afterwards , his predecessor , Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded \" enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily \" because its supporters no longer understood \" what the party stands for \" . Margaret Curran , the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland , said that although the party was changing , it needed to reconnect with its \" socialist principles \" ."

    "text": "Developing neurons travel toward the olfactory bulb along the RMS via glial tubes , which mark the division between the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics . Uniquely , the cells travel tangential to the brain surface , parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons . Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe this is not the case . Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes . They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP ( glial fibrillary acidic protein ) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology . Furthermore , these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression , a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells . The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule , a polysialylated ( PSA ) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) called PSA @-@ NCAM , as well as β @-@ tubulin , a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts , proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb . With the removal of NCAM , the neuroblasts scatter , proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation . The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes . Once the developing neurons reach the core of the olfactory bulb , they detach from the RMS , which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli , this migration is dependent on tenascin @-@ R , and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons . These neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and confocal imaging ."

The second rule was not originally held to be valid , and in the 17th Century third parties were allowed to enforce terms of a contract that benefited them , as shown in Provender v Wood [ 1627 ] Hetley 30 , where the judgement stated that \" the party to whom the benefit of a promise accrews , may bring his action . \" The first reversal of this was in Bourne v Mason [ 1669 ] 1 Vent . , where the Court of King 's Bench found that a third party had no rights to enforce a contract that benefited him .

Nevertheless , Virginia did not experience the type of mass hysteria evidenced by the Salem , Massachusetts witch trials in 1692 – 1693 , where 19 people were executed on allegations of sorcery , several years before the first accusations against Sherwood .

As well as the masts the bulkheads had been smashed apart and all deck furniture blasted to splinters . 65 of the crew had been killed , including Captain Beaulieu , and approximately 80 wounded , more than a third of the crew listed as casualties ; many of the wounded later died from the effects of amputation . Damages to Sybille were considerably lighter : only six shot had struck the hull in the entire battle : one gun was dismounted , but the worst damage was to Cooke 's cabin where a round shot had destroyed most of his furniture . In addition , most of the damage to the masts and rigging proved superficial . Just five crew were killed outright , with another 17 wounded , the latter including Cooke . The British captain had been struck in the left arm , the shot exiting near his spine , with additional injuries to the chest and right arm . He eventually died after a long and agonising deterioration at Calcutta on 25 May 1799 and was buried under a monument with full military honours . A memorial was subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey in his memory ."

The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production , which was known as the \" instructive \" hypothesis . Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation , and in the second edition of \" The Production of Antibodies \" , he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome , thus effecting the production of antibodies . In 1956 he became interested in Niels Kaj Jerne 's natural selection hypothesis , which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel @-@ winning immunologist Paul Ehrlich . Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and , that upon binding , more antibodies to that antigen would be produced . Burnet developed a model which he named clonal selection that expanded on and improved Jerne 's hypothesis . Burnet proposed that each lymphocyte bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen .

Dr. J.G. de Casparis , a scholar of ancient Indonesian writing , gave the preliminary judgment that the style of the script might date from an earlier period such as the 10th or 11th century . He was able to decipher one or two words , which seemed to be in the Old Javanese language . On the other hand , Drs. Boechari , epigraphical expert of the Indonesian National Research Centre for Archaeology and lecturer at the University of Indonesia , was of the opinion that the engraving dates from no later than the 12th century , has a closer affinity to the Sumatran than the Javanese writing style , and that the language may not be Old Javanese but Sanskrit , which was in common use in Sumatra at that era . John Miksic has commented that while it is impossible to determine whether de Casparis 's or Boechari 's theory is more correct on the basis of epigraphy alone , it is easier to accept the conclusion that the person who commissioned the inscription was culturally Sumatran rather than Javanese , because by the 10th century the linguistic influence of Java had reached the Lampung region in the south of Sumatra , but no such influence has been discovered as far north as Singapore and there is no evidence of Javanese colonisation in Sumatra or the offshore islands at that time . Miksic notes that most conclusions regarding the slab have been on the basis of rubbings or photographs , and thus there is a \" slight possibility \" that detailed analysis of fragments of the sandstone slab may provide more information about the age of the inscription or the nature of its contents . However , he also says that the script probably never will be fully deciphered ."

The \" Party Gauge \" slowly fills as party members successfully land hits on the enemy players , and filling the gauge allows the player to chain multiple attacks together , for extra damage . All party members have an \" aggro ring \" around them as well ; the more actions a character performs , the larger it grows . Larger aggro rings lead enemies to focus their efforts on that respective character , leading to a strategic aspect of luring and diverting attention of enemies . Each character has a \" Tension \" gauge , which represents a character 's morale : at its highest point , characters have a high probability of dealing a critical blow and less chance of missing an enemy . The game 's \" Vision \" system , where main character Shulk can see glimpses of enemies ' future attacks , also factors into battles . With knowledge of an enemy 's potentially dangerous attack , the player can prevent it from happening by alerting a teammate , allowing the player to activate one of their Arts , or by using an Art of their own to stop the attack . The Vision system is tied to the \" Party \" gauge , which is filled by boosting team morale , using Arts with special effects , and avoiding or dealing critical hits .

Liszt constructed compositions with varying sections of music not necessarily having distinct beginnings and ends . He sketched sections , sometimes without fully completing them , on a small number of staves with some indication of the orchestration . After an assistant — August Conradi from 1848 to 1849 , Joachim Raff from 1850 to 1853 — had realized Liszt 's ideas and provided a score of an acceptable standard , Liszt would then make further revisions ; he moved sections to form different structural relationships , and modified connective materials or composed them anew , completing the piece of music . The score was copied , then tried out in rehearsals with the Weimarian Court orchestra and further changes made in the light of practical experience . Many years later , Liszt reminisced how his compositional development hinged on hearing an orchestra perform his works : \" I needed to hear them in order to get an idea of them . \" He added that it was much more for this reason , and not simply for securing a public for his own works , that he promoted them in Weimar and elsewhere . After many such stages of composition , rehearsal and revision , Liszt might reach a version where the musical form seemed balanced and he was satisfied .

She recorded another duet for the album , titled \" Healthy Love \" , with singer Cindy Heinold . In the fall of 1998 , Robyn had an abortion , which she revealed to the public months later in an issue of Café Magazine .

There was no push from the military for the weapon , because the AEC regarded it as too secret to inform either its own Military Liaison Committee or the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project about it . In September 1949 , the Soviet Union detonated a nuclear device . It fell to Oppenheimer , as chairman of the AEC General Advisory Committee ( GAC ) , to decide whether the United States should develop the Super in response . The Super design used large quantities of tritium , which could only be manufactured in a reactor , and therefore at the expense of plutonium production for smaller weapons , so the GAC advised against it . Nonetheless , Truman approved the Super on January 31 , 1950 . Because of the secrecy surrounding the decision , accounts published in the 1950s incorrectly portrayed Oppenheimer as obstructing its development on political grounds , and this was a factor in the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 ."

Here , as in many of Schubert 's sonata form movements , a repeat sign is written for an exceedingly long exposition , while the material of the exposition is repeated a third time in the recapitulation with little alteration . This has led some musicians to omit the exposition repeat when performing these movements . In the last two sonatas , however , unlike other movements , the first ending of the exposition contains several additional bars of music , leading back to the movement 's opening . When performing the movement without the repeat , the music in these bars is totally omitted from the performance , as it does not appear in the second ending . Furthermore , in the B @-@ flat sonata , these added bars contain strikingly novel material , which does not appear anywhere else in the piece , and is radically different from the second ending . Pianist András Schiff has described the omission of the repeat in these two movements as \" the amputation of a limb \" .

Again , on 3 July 1402 , the burgh and cathedral precinct were attacked , this time by Alexander of Lochaber , brother of Domhnall of Islay , Lord of the Isles ; he spared the cathedral but burned the manses . For this act , Lochaber and his captains were excommunicated , prompting Lochaber 's return in September to give reparation and gain absolution . In 1408 , the money saved during an ecclesiastic vacancy was diverted to the rebuilding process and in 1413 a grant from the customs of Inverness was provided . Increasingly , the appropriation of the parish church revenues led in many cases to churches becoming dilapidated and unable to attract educated priests .

This caused some controversy , as the North Carolina General Assembly , which was customarily consulted for the promotion of generals from that state , had already nominated Thomas Clark and Jethro Sumner for promotion to the rank of brigadier general . Sumner was promoted , but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun , who received the support of nine of the thirteen states . Hogun 's surprising victory was due in large part Burke 's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress .

Estimates of bread consumption from different regions are fairly similar : around 1 to 1 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 2 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 3 lb ) of bread per person per day . Among the first town guilds to be organized were the bakers ' , and laws and regulations were passed to keep bread prices stable . The English Assize of Bread and Ale of 1266 listed extensive tables where the size , weight , and price of a loaf of bread were regulated in relation to grain prices . The baker 's profit margin stipulated in the tables was later increased through successful lobbying from the London Baker 's Company by adding the cost of everything from firewood and salt to the baker 's wife , house , and dog . Since bread was such a central part of the medieval diet , swindling by those who were trusted with supplying the precious commodity to the community was considered a serious offense . Bakers who were caught tampering with weights or adulterating dough with less expensive ingredients could receive severe penalties . This gave rise to the \" baker 's dozen \" : a baker would give 13 for the price of 12 , to be certain of not being known as a cheat ."

Much of the pressure for the coins to be struck was being applied by the Senate Majority Leader , Mike Mansfield ( Democrat – Montana ) , who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars . Preparations for the striking proceeded at a reluctant Mint Bureau . Some working dies had survived Sinnock 's 1937 destruction order , but were found to be in poor condition , and Mint Assistant Engraver ( later Chief Engraver ) Frank Gasparro was authorized to produce new ones . Mint officials had also considered using Morgan 's design ; this idea was dropped and Gasparro replicated the Peace dollar dies . The reverse dies all bore Denver mintmarks ; as the coins were slated for circulation in the West , it was deemed logical to strike them nearby ."

Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density . At the critical point , this derivative is zero , leading to large fluctuations . The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered , making the fluid look milky white . Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength , and which explains why the sky is blue . Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter ."

Jack Tsen @-@ Ta Lee has suggested that these fundamental rules are both procedural and substantive in nature , and that substantive natural justice gives the courts discretion to strike down a law if its very object is unreasonable and oppressive . Under this view , to interpret Article 9 ( 1 ) as permitting Parliament to enact any provision that derogates from an individual 's personal liberty no matter how arbitrary or oppressive as long as procedural natural justice is observed , drains it of all content . Also , instead of the invalidation of legislation in this manner being seen as an encroachment by the judiciary into the legislature 's sphere , the application of substantive natural justice would simply be a full exercise of the judiciary 's proper constitutional role . Lee submits that Singapore courts should follow the Indian courts and apply a reasonableness test to determine if legislation is substantively constitutional . Ultimately , being able to review legislation by applying the substantive aspect of natural justice would \" entitle courts to examine whether it is appropriate for the legislature to deprive individual of certain aspects of their personal liberty , and the manner in which such deprivation is achieved . \""

First of all , El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup , leaving behind Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González . According to Luis Guevara Mora , goalkeeper of the team by that time , the Salvadoran Football Federation decided to take members of the Federation , as well as the friends and family of many members of the Federation , and spent so much money they couldn 't afford to bring a full 22 – man squad . Some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their teammates but couldn 't get enough . Further heightening controversy , the team took many detours and stops throughout Europe under the direction of the Federation , taking 3 days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so . Once arrived , there was more trouble . Adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player , but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived . The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association . They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake . Next , someone stole the balls that the team would train with . The day prior to the match against Hungary , the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them while El Salvador had none and was unable to train . To make things even worse , El Salvador had never seen Hungary play . The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone outdated video that they had bought . On the field there were more problems . Hungary 's fourth goal was caused by Francisco Jovel 's sudden deafness . Jovel had received a heavy blow on the cheek and almost could not hear . So when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball , the defender did not hear him . Mora attempted to pass to Jovel , but Jovel wasn 't looking and the ball went past him and went straight in front of the net . The Hungarian player only had to tap it in . After the match , the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation . The coach was dismissed immediately and the following matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel , Huezo and Fagoaga . Although the tournament overall was a big disappointment , there were also several bright spots . Jorge \" Mágico \" González was considered by the national and international press as the best player . \" Mágico \" González stayed in Spain after the tournament and played for Cádiz CF and Real Valladolid .

Remarking on the popular trend of remaking cult films , Claude Brodesser @-@ Akner of New York magazine states that Hollywood studios have been superstitiously hoping to recreate past successes rather than trading on nostalgia . Their popularity would bring some critics to proclaim the death of cult films now that they have finally become successful and mainstream , are too slick to attract a proper cult following , lack context , or are too easily found online . In response , David Church says that cult film fans have retreated to more obscure and difficult to find films , often using illegal distribution methods , which preserves the outlaw status of cult films . Virtual spaces , such as online forums and fan sites , replace the traditional fanzines and newsletters . Cult film fans consider themselves collectors , rather than consumers , as they associate consumers with mainstream , Hollywood audiences . This collecting can take the place of fetishization of a single film . Addressing concerns that DVDs have revoked the cult status of films like Rocky Horror , academic Mikel J. Koven states that small scale screenings with friends and family can replace midnight showings . Koven also identifies television shows , such as Twin Peaks , as retaining more traditional cult activities inside popular culture .

    "text": "The social contract theory of political philosopher John Rawls , developed in his work A Theory of Justice , was influenced by Kant 's ethics . Rawls argued that a just society would be fair . To achieve this fairness , he proposed a hypothetical moment prior to the existence of a society , at which the society is ordered : this is the original position . This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance , where no one knows what their own position in society will be , preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result . Rawls ' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free , equal , and moral ; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality , which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice . Rawls dismissed much of Kant 's dualism , arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics , once reformulated , is clearer without it — he described this as one of the goals of A Theory of Justice ."

In a 1929 case , Higgins , then a Justice of the High Court , suggested ( as obiter dictum ) that a person could lawfully object to compulsory voting on the grounds of religious belief .

With a broad upper ridge anchored along the Yucatán coast , diffluence aloft in the vicinity of the disturbance provided focus for the development of scattered convection . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) noted an environment supportive of tropical development , and by September 27 a broad surface low formed amid the convection . The next day , surface pressures steadily dropped as sustained winds around the low increased to near tropical storm force . Throughout the development process , moderate westerly wind shear over the region caused the disturbance to exhibit a rather asymmetric structure ; it developed an elongated low @-@ pressure center by September 28 , well to the northwest of its strongest wind field . Despite the asymmetry , the NHC initiated advisories on a tropical depression around 15 : 00 UTC that day , after surface and satellite observations revealed a sufficiently defined circulation center west of the deep convection . Post @-@ season reassessments , however , indicated that a tropical storm had in fact formed three hours earlier , about 75 miles ( 120 km ) south of Cuba 's Isle of Youth ."

Although Edward VI 's practical influence on government was limited , his intense Protestantism made a reforming administration obligatory ; his succession was managed by the reforming faction , who continued in power throughout his reign . The man Edward trusted most , Thomas Cranmer , Archbishop of Canterbury , introduced a series of religious reforms that revolutionised the English church from one that — while rejecting papal supremacy — remained essentially Catholic , to one that was institutionally Protestant . The confiscation of church property that had begun under Henry VIII resumed under Edward — notably with the dissolution of the chantries — to the great monetary advantage of the crown and the new owners of the seized property . Church reform was therefore as much a political as a religious policy under Edward VI . By the end of his reign , the church had been financially ruined , with much of the property of the bishops transferred into lay hands ."

Much of the disaster 's destruction can be produced by these flood waters , which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along . Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event . In such cases , it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first , which may not be the biggest or most destructive . Occasionally , in a shallow bay or estuary , a tsunami may transform into a bore ."

The bacteria had also been observed in 1979 , by Robin Warren , who researched it further with Barry Marshall from 1981 . After unsuccessful attempts at culturing the bacteria from the stomach , they finally succeeded in visualizing colonies in 1982 , when they unintentionally left their Petri dishes incubating for five days over the Easter weekend . In their original paper , Warren and Marshall contended that most stomach ulcers and gastritis were caused by bacterial infection and not by stress or spicy food , as had been assumed before ."

In administrative law , a legitimate expectation generally arises when there has been a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual . To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness . The doctrine of legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts . Thus , where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority , the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken . Alternatively , an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right . The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority 's policy . This suggests the adoption of a free @-@ standing proportionality approach , which has been said not to apply in administrative law ."

The Junkyard was designed to emphasize the desperation of the characters during their awakening .

The idea did not appear in the finished game , but eventually reemerged and became the base for Digital Devil Saga 's gameplay .

Operationally , the system was treated as an easterly wave until it moved through the Bahamas . It is believed that the system originated near the Cape Verde islands . On August 24 , the tropical storm passed north of the Leeward Islands and San Juan , Puerto Rico , and then strengthened to a minimal hurricane with 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds on August 25 . Subsequently , it strengthened rapidly , and the cyclone was noted as \" well developed \" when it passed near Nassau with 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) winds on the morning of August 26 . At the time , it was the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The storm strengthened further over the Gulf Stream , and it moved ashore over the city of West Palm Beach as a strong Category 4 hurricane around 7 : 20 p.m. EDT . The city 's airport reported calm conditions from 7 : 20 – 7 : 40 p.m. , and the minimum central pressure of 954 mbar ( 28 @.@ 18 inHg ) was measured at the site . Peak gusts were recorded at 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) before the anemometer blew away . A maximum sustained wind of 153 mph ( 246 km / h ) was reported from the Jupiter Inlet Light station prior to the loss of the anemometer ; although conditions were slightly more severe after the reading , reliable estimates are unavailable . The Atlantic hurricane database lists the cyclone as a strong Category 4 hurricane at landfall . The wind reading is the basis for the Category 4 designation in the Atlantic hurricane database , although a reduction from the anemometer 's elevated location lends credence to the concept of a weaker system . Originally , the system was designated as a Category 3 hurricane in the state of Florida , based on the minimum central pressure reading of 954 mbar ( 28 @.@ 18 inHg ) ; this pressure corresponds to the original classification of a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . However , modern analysis applies Saffir @-@ Simpson rankings based on maximum sustained wind speeds . The 1949 Florida hurricane will be eventually reanalyzed by the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project , which may find a weaker hurricane in Florida . The central pressure of 954 mbar ( 28 @.@ 18 inHg ) is unusually high for a strong Category 4 hurricane ; the reanalysis project has discovered that hurricanes erroneously featured stronger winds than the typical pressure / wind relationship in the 1940s – 1960s , unlike subsequent hurricanes in the 1970s – 1980s . The evidence suggests wind speeds may have been overestimated for hurricanes in the 1940s – 1960s ."

Gerry , who sought to leave with them , stayed behind because Talleyrand threatened war if he left . Gerry refused to make any significant negotiations afterward and left Paris in August . By then dispatches describing the commission 's reception had been published in the United States , raising calls for war . The undeclared naval Quasi @-@ War ( 1798 – 1800 ) followed . Federalists , notably Secretary of State Timothy Pickering , accused Gerry of supporting the French and abetting the breakdown of the talks , while Adams and Republicans such as Thomas Jefferson supported him . The negative press damaged Gerry 's reputation , and he was burned in effigy by protestors in front of his home . He was only later vindicated , when his correspondence with Talleyrand was published . In response to the Federalist attacks on him , and because of his perception that the Federalist @-@ led military buildup threatened republican values , Gerry formally joined the Democratic @-@ Republican Party in early 1800 , standing for election as Governor of Massachusetts ."

In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line from Enfield to Liverpool Street station , including a station at Bruce Grove , close to Bruce Castle ; the railway provided subsidised workmen 's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London . As a major rail hub , Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area ; by the end of the 19th century , the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself , and the waterlogged floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm ."

Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy , a disease also known as \" lion jaw \" , and is sometimes also referred to as \" westie jaw \" . The disease is an autosomal recessive condition , so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty gene . The condition appears across many breeds , including several different types of terriers , as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane . It typically appears in dogs under a year old , and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food . Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition , in which the bones around the jaw thicken ; additionally , the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels . The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old , and in some cases can recede . It is normally treated with anti @-@ inflammatory medications , and the feeding of soft foods . In some cases , tube feeding may be necessary .

He collected his stories , poetry , cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High School exercise book that he called the Daily Howl . The drawings were often of crippled people , and the writings satirical , and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay . According to classmate Bill Turner , Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton , to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it . Turner said that Lennon \" had an obsession for Wigan Pier . It kept cropping up \" , and in Lennon 's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine , \" the mine was at the end of Wigan Pier . \" Turner described how one of Lennon 's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question , \" Why ? \" . Above was a flying pancake , and below , \" a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog — also wearing glasses \" ."

The clypeus , legs and antennae are covered in punctulates ( spots ) , and the postpetiole and gaster have less punctulates . M. inquilina can be distinguished from other ants due to its lack of pilose ( long soft hairs ) ; only small erect setae are mostly found on the mandibles and gastric apex , but short hair can be found on the legs , and on the dorsum , thorax and cervix . The ant has pubescence ( soft short hair ) finer and more abundant than M. vindex .

The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign , with Hayes endorsing Sherman 's position and his Democratic opponent , incumbent Governor William Allen , in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks redeemable in bonds . Hayes won a narrow victory , and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876 . The controversy over resumption carried into the presidential election . The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the Resumption Act , while the Republicans nominated Hayes , whose position in favor of a gold standard was well known . The election of 1876 was very close and the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated . Louisiana was one of the states in which both parties claimed victory , and Grant asked Sherman and a few other men to go to New Orleans and ensure the party 's interests were represented ."

But when you saw the rushes in the projection room the next day you could read in his face all the things he 'd been thinking . \" Sam Wood , who directed Cooper in four films , had similar observations about Cooper 's performance in Pride of the Yankees , noting , \" What I thought was underplaying turned out to be just the right approach . On the screen he 's perfect , yet on the set you 'd swear it 's the worst job of acting in the history of motion pictures . \" His fellow actors also admired his abilities as an actor . Commenting on her two films playing opposite Cooper , actress Ingrid Bergman concluded , \" The personality of this man was so enormous , so overpowering — and that expression in his eyes and his face , it was so delicate and so underplayed . You just didn 't notice it until you saw it on the screen . I thought he was marvelous ; the most underplaying and the most natural actor I ever worked with . \""

    "text": "In 1987 , Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky elevated the subfamily at family level , renaming it as Sphecomyrmidae to accommodate Sphecomyrma and other fossil insects he studied throughout the Soviet Union . This placement was only short @-@ lived as Wilson , with new morphological evidence , elevated the family back to subfamily level and all studied Cretaceous ants were put into Sphecomyrma or Cretomyrma . However , Dlussky and Russian palaeoentomologist Elena B. Fedoseeva retained their classification and Sphecomyrma remained under Sphecomyrmidae . Their reasons were that the first segments of the antenna were too short to be elbowed and the structure of the mandibles . As elbowed antennae allow brood and food manipulation , or even sociality , it is impossible to classify Sphecomyrma and relatives as ants . Despite the authors ' notes , they did not cite any study as to how ants manipulate items and such with their antennae , but he may have implied that the apices , a feature found on the antenna , may have been too far away from the mandibles . The close distance of the apices from the mandibles would allow manipulation of food or antennation with other nestmates . Another issue was whether or not a metapleural gland was present , a unique feature only found in ants . Despite this and previous claims made by Dlussky saying that sphecomyrmines including Sphecomyrma were most likely solitary or semi @-@ communal , the confirmed existence of the metapleural gland through newly collected fossils confirms that Sphecomyrma and relatives were definitely social . The evidence against Dlussky eventually reinstated Sphecomyrma and the subfamily as members of Formicidae in 1997 , although some sources published before 1997 did not formally recognise Sphecomyrminae at family level . Additional doubts surrounding the nature of Sphecomyrma and relatives emerged when a 1999 paper concluded that the fossil ants found in Cretaceous amber in New Jersey were closer to wasps than they were to ants . This was quickly dismissed due to overwhelming evidence supporting their placement within the Formicidae , and the fact the authors cited unpublished cladograms and disregarded the key diagnostic traits ( synapomorphies ) found in the ants ."

This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source ( such as a star ) and the velocity of its observer ( see diagram on the right ) . A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position . Since the direction of the Earth 's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun , this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around . From the angular difference in the position of stars ( maximally 20 @.@ 5 arcseconds ) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth 's velocity around the Sun , which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth .

    "text": "Historically , English patent law was based on custom and the common law , not on statute . It began as the Crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production . As gifts from the crown , there was no judicial review , oversight or consideration , and no actual law developed around patents . This practice came from the guilds , groups who were controlled by the Crown and held monopolies over particular industries . By the 14th century the economy of England was lagging behind that of other European nations , with the guilds too small to control industrial production successfully . To remedy this , Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England , offering \" letters of protection \" that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge . The first recorded letter of protection was given in 1331 . The letters did not grant a full monopoly ; rather they acted as an extended passport , allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade . An exceptional example ( considered the first full patent in England ) was issued to John of Utynam on 3 April 1449 , granting him a monopoly . Overseas , the practice of granting full industrial patents and monopolies became common in Italian states by the 1420s ."

This had not been implemented , and so the lower caisson would not sink deep enough for either boat to be floated out . Attempts to fit gates and to let the water in the chamber drain to waste had proved ineffective . Ultimately , lock chambers were built at the foot of the each lift . These were filled with water from the upper level , so that the boat could float out , and it then descended the final 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) as it would in a conventional lock . Only the lift at Greenham used Anderson 's principle , and included a proper drain to lower the level in the chambers ."

Bittinger 's historical research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his Allegheny Passage ( 1990 ) , it is noted that the Church of the Brethren denomination recognized Old Pine Church as belonging to the larger Beaver Run congregation , which was centered approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Old Pine Church . The Beaver Run congregation was the first organization of the Brethren in Hampshire County . Old Pine Church and its predecessor structures were probably utilized by members of the Beaver Run congregation because the distance between the northern region of the valley and the church on Beaver Run was too great to traverse easily . Thus , Old Pine Church began as a mission of the Beaver Run congregation . Because of its location in the vicinity of the Hardy County boundary line , the district served by the church spanned both counties ."

Hinoue was able to design Ayu any way she wanted , and by all means she wanted Ayu to wear her large tan duffle coat , and be depicted as a strong character . Hinoue said that she was very particular about Ayu 's attire , but not about everything . At the time she was formulating the character design , many festivals were going on in Osaka , Japan where Key is located . When Hinoue had a chance to attend , there were many people around wearing angel wings as part of the festival , and because she thought they looked cute , she later chose to draw them onto Ayu as well . Hinoue later read Ayu 's finished scenario and became aware of an unintentional form of foreshadowing on her part due to wing imagery factoring into Ayu 's story . Shortly after , Hisaya suggested to Hinoue , \" Since they seem to have become a spoiler , let 's lose the wings . \" The wings were thus removed , but before long they were attached again . While Hinoue had originally chosen the colors for the hair and eyes of the characters herself , these were later discussed by the development team and altered accordingly , though Ayu , Mai , and Nayuki did not change much . It came to the point where Hinoue had to constantly go back and forth between her intentions and what was later decided by consensus ."

The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions , with airborne descents by three additional divisions , to allow operations on a wider front and speed up the capture of the port at Cherbourg . The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June .

Many scientists observed that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins , but others ( such as Nobel laureate Richard Willstätter ) argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis . In 1926 , James B. Sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it ; he did likewise for the enzyme catalase in 1937 . The conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively demonstrated by John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley , who worked on the digestive enzymes pepsin ( 1930 ) , trypsin and chymotrypsin .

The re @-@ alignment brought increased competition to qualify for the playoffs , as there were now 16 teams in the Eastern Conference fighting for eight playoff spots . The season began with a changing of leadership , as on September 14 , 2013 , the Ottawa Senators named Jason Spezza their eighth captain in franchise history . While new addition Clarke MacArthur had a career year , Ryan and Spezza struggled to find chemistry , and Ryan was moved to a line with MacArthur and Kyle Turris , where he fared much better . Bobby Ryan also ran into injury problems during the season , and while there were times where Joe Corvo played solidly , he eventually lost his place in the lineup . The club struggled on defence , as shots and goals against numbers increased from the previous season . The club was a sub .500 team much of the season , or only a few games above and never was in a playoff position all season .

In the British language , this was called the teulu , as in teulu Dewr ( the \" War @-@ band of Deira \" ) . In Latin the word is either comitatus or tutores , or even familia ; tutores is the most common word in this period , and derives for the Latin verb tueor , meaning \" defend , preserve from danger \" . The war @-@ band functioned as an extension of the ruler 's legal person , and was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size . In peace @-@ time , the war @-@ band 's activity was centred on the \" Great Hall \" . Here , in both Germanic and Celtic cultures , the feasting , drinking and other forms of male bonding that kept up the war @-@ band 's integrity would take place . In the epic poem Beowulf , the war @-@ band was said to sleep in the Great Hall after the lord had retired to his adjacent bedchamber . It is not likely that any war @-@ band in the period exceeded 120 – 150 men , as no hall structure having a capacity larger than this has been found by archaeologists in northern Britain . Pictish stones , like that at Aberlemno in Angus , show mounted and foot warriors with swords , spears , bows , helmets and shields . The large number of hill forts in Scotland may have made open battle less important than in Anglo @-@ Saxon England and the relatively high proportion of kings who are recorded as dying in fires or drowning suggest that sieges were a more important part of warfare in Northern Britain ."

Religious laws and expectations , or \" personal laws \" enumerated by each specific religion , often conflict with the Indian Constitution , eliminating rights and powers women should legally have . Despite these crossovers in legality , the Indian government does not interfere with religion and the personal laws they hold . Religions , like Hinduism , call for women to be faithful servants to God and their husbands . They have a term called pativrata that describes a wife who has accepted service and devotion to her husband and his family as her ultimate religion and duty . Indian society is largely composed of hierarchical systems within families and communities . These hierarchies can be broken down into age , sex , ordinal position , kinship relationships ( within families ) , and caste , lineage , wealth , occupations , and relationship to ruling power ( within the community ) . When hierarchies emerge within the family based on social convention and economic need , girls in poorer families suffer twice the impact of vulnerability and stability . From birth , girls are automatically entitled to less ; from playtime , to food , to education , girls can expect to always be entitled to less than their brothers . Girls also have less access to their family 's income and assets , which is exacerbated among poor , rural Indian families .

In relation to de Silva 's treatment of this notion , Dyrness states that insights into the biblical picture of human life apart from God cannot be found by a dialogue with Buddhism , but by Christian Asians carefully considering the Scriptures and their own Asian setting . A similar perspective is taken by Lim et al . , who insist that de Silva should communicate the Christian message to the Buddhists , instead of giving Buddhist meanings to Christian concepts and harmonising in a syncretistic way the concepts belonging to the two religions . In a publication that aims at an evangelical approach to religions and cultures , Yung interprets de Silva 's contribution as not so much an able exercise in dialogue , but , rather , a brilliant Christian apologetic , addressed to Theravada Buddhists ."

    "text": "Blackburn remained in Canada to avoid prosecution by U.S. authorities , but he returned to his home country in 1868 to help combat a yellow fever outbreak along the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana . Although the charges against him had not been dropped , he was not arrested or prosecuted . He rehabilitated his public image by rendering aid in yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis , Tennessee , in 1873 , Fernandina , Florida , in 1877 , and Hickman , Kentucky , in 1878 . Dubbed the \" Hero of Hickman \" , Blackburn 's ministrations propelled him to the Democratic gubernatorial nomination the following year . In the general election , he defeated Republican Walter Evans by a wide margin . As governor , Blackburn won passage of several reforms in the areas of state finance and internal improvements , but his signature accomplishments were in the area of penal reform . Troubled by the conditions at the penitentiary in Frankfort , Blackburn attempted to ease overcrowding through liberal use of his gubernatorial pardon , earning him the derisive nickname \" Lenient Luke \" . He also secured approval of the construction of a new penitentiary at Eddyville , the adoption of a warden system to replace the corrupt private oversight of the old penitentiary , and the implementation of the state 's first parole system . Although his record of reform led historians to laud him as \" the father of prison reform in Kentucky \" , his liberal pardon record and expenditure of scarce taxpayer money to improve the living conditions of prisoners was unpopular at the time , and he was booed and shouted down at his own party 's nominating convention in 1883 . After his term as governor , he returned to his medical practice and died in 1887 . The Blackburn Correctional Complex , a minimum @-@ security penal facility near Lexington , Kentucky , was named in his honor in 1972 ."

B. prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups . It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark , and so cannot be considered a resprouter ; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height , the sparseness of its foliage , and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier .

At Antietam , where there was nowhere for him to flee to , he fell into a paralysis of indecision . Seen from a longer perspective , General McClellan could be both comfortable and successful performing as executive officer , and also , if somewhat less successfully , as grand strategist ; as battlefield commander , however , he was simply in the wrong profession ."

Under this scheme , as articulated by the Assembly , God 's dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants : the covenant of works and covenant of grace . The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works ( sometimes called the covenant of life ) , in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience . In the fall of man , Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil . To remedy this , God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace . This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God 's law perfectly . The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology . The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people ."

Wyler obliged , loved the play , and with de Havilland 's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights . Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James , the film is about a young naïve woman who falls in love with a young man , over the objections of her emotionally abusive father who suspects the man of being a gold digger . As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn , de Havilland portrays a character 's transformation from a shy trusting innocent to a guarded mature woman over a period of years . Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements , gestures , and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman . Her timid voice , nervous hands , downcast eyes , and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize . Throughout the production , Wyler pressed de Havilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character . In the scene where Catherine returns home after being jilted , the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine 's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script . The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics .

It was not before 1943 that Bernard Grdseloff discovered the tomb of Persen , a priest at the court of Userkaf and Neferhetepes .

In his will he gave \" the most parte of all my Latten bookes whereof shall be made a catalogue as shortelie as I may God sendinge me lief \" , although obtaining these books was not without its difficulties . Initially the executors of his will used \" all the cullerable shifts and practices \" to prevent the books from moving to the school . These continued to such an extent that the mayor was forced to complain to the Lord High Treasurer , William Cecil , who summoned the executors to London . Upon a hearing with the executors , the Lord Treasurer referred them to Sir Walter Mildmay who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time . He demanded that the executors give everything left in the Will to the school . Following the ruling , however , the books passed to Edmund Freke , the new Bishop of Norwich , who kept them for himself at his residence . This continued until the school obtained letters from Her Majesty 's Privy Council requiring the books be delivered . The books then finally arrived at the school several years late , although the Bishop kept a number of the best for himself . Since this date the library has been added to , most notably between 1600 and 1800 . The library is housed within the Gallery ( now the Headmaster 's Study ) in the Old Building , with the present bookcases dating from 1897 . The oldest book within the library was printed in Venice around 1480 , with the oldest English book printed in about 1500 bearing the imprint of Wynkyn de Worde .

In Abenteuer eines Junggesellen Busch illustrates a form of nonviolent progressive education that fails in one scene , and caning in the following scene ; the canings that ensued indicate Busch 's pessimistic picture of life , which has its roots in the Protestant ethic of the 19th century , in which he believed that man is inherently evil and will never master his vices .

She was a companion to her hypochondriac mother and , in later life , a hostess with her father during her mother 's long periods of indisposition . She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons , subjects in which she was accomplished . Her parents were very protective of her , attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty . As a result , she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds ' estates . A cousin , who seems to have disliked her , claims that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase \" the poor \" was just a meaningless euphemism to her . This is likely to be an exaggeration , as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor , in housing and education . Whatever the faults of her education , she possessed great confidence , impressing her Rothschild relations , who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the Prince of Wales while only 17 years of age ."

He provided evidence that the coalition governments established public education in the South , and many needed social service programs . The book also demonstrated the ways in which black emancipation – the crux of Reconstruction – promoted a radical restructuring of United States society , as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for civil rights for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction ."

In this technique a minimum is first found and the attenuator adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark . A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark . The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave . Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the attenuator and not at all on the detector ."

    "text": "The style of Cabernet Sauvignon is strongly influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest . When more on the unripe side , the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors . When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants . Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine . When Cabernet Sauvignon is young , the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum . The aroma of blackcurrants is one of the most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe . Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus , mint and tobacco . As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar , cigar boxes and pencil shavings . In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes ."

    "text": "The House of Lords ' statement on parliamentary privilege was assessed by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege , which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart , but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege . However , academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it . Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used ; the House of Lords was essentially saying that , where a minister has made a statement about an act 's intent that was not questioned by Parliament , that statement can be used as evidence . However , there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement , and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it ; in the case of the Finance Act , for example , it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute , they found no reason to actively oppose it . At the same time , different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons . The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees ; only that Parliament also feels , for whatever reason , that the provision should be included . The decision also raises questions about the separation of powers in the United Kingdom ; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament , not the executive , which passes legislation . If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament , it violates this separation of powers , allowing the executive to make law ."

    "text": "Spanish , Dutch , and English traders brought guinea pigs to Europe , where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty , including Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547 , in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo ; because cavies are not native to Hispaniola , the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers . However , based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands , the animal must have been introduced by ceramic @-@ making horticulturalists from South America to the Caribbean around 500 BC , and it was present in the Ostionoid period , for example , on Puerto Rico , long before the advent of the Spaniards . The guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner . Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777 ; it is an amalgam of Pallas ' generic designation ( 1766 ) and Linnaeus ' specific conferral ( 1758 ) . The earliest known illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting ( artist unknown ) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London , dated to 1580 , which shows a girl in typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise @-@ shell guinea pig in her hands ; she is flanked by her two brothers , one of whom holds a pet bird . The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England , which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall ( Essex ) , an Elizabethan manor house , and dated to around 1575 ."

They are written for a variety of voices ( tenor in all five ; counter @-@ tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV ) and accompaniments ( piano in I to IV , horn in III and harp in V ) . The first is a setting of Francis Quarles 's 17th century poem \" A Divine Rapture \" , and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell 's Divine Hymns . Matthews describes it as one of the composer 's most serene works , which \" ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten 's music \" . The second Canticle was written in 1952 , between Billy Budd and Gloriana , on the theme of Abraham 's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac . \" Canticle III \" from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell 's wartime poem \" Still Falls the Rain \" , composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated . The twelve @-@ note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten 's compositional technique .

It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966 ; Matthews refers to it as a \" companion piece \" to the earlier work . The final Canticle was another Eliot setting , his juvenile poem \" Death of Saint Narcissus \" . Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about , the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text \" almost frighteningly apt ... for a composer conscious of his own sickness \" .

In late 24 or early 23 BC , charges were brought against Marcus Primus , the former proconsul ( governor ) of Macedonia , for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the Odrysian kingdom of Thrace , whose king was a Roman ally . He was defended by Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena , who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus , ordering him to attack the client state . Later , Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus . Such orders , had they been given , would have been considered a breach of the Senate 's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath — i.e. , before Augustus was granted imperium proconsulare maius — as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate 's jurisdiction , not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus . Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus , and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen , a first among equals . Even worse , the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus 's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps , instituting a form of monarchy – accusations that had already played out ."

CN and CS are the most widely used and known , but around 15 different types of tear gas have been developed worldwide e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone , CNB , and CNC . CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect . The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol . The size of solution droplets and the size of the CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body ."

The two eldest surviving sons of Romanos I , co @-@ emperors Stephen and Constantine , were jealous of Kourkouas and had in the past tried to undermine him , albeit without success . Following the success of Kourkouas in the East , Romanos I considered marrying his trusted general into the imperial family . Kourkouas 's daughter Euphrosyne was to be wedded with the emperor 's grandson , the future Romanos II ( r . 959 – 963 ) , the son of his son @-@ in @-@ law and junior emperor Constantine VII . Although such a union would effectively cement the loyalty of the army , it would also strengthen the position of the legitimate Macedonian line , represented by Constantine VII , over the imperial claims of Romanos 's own sons .

However , despite initial indications that he would pursue a 1514 campaign , Henry decided against such a move . He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had got back little ; England 's own coffers were now empty . With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X , who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France , Henry signed his own treaty with Louis : his sister Mary would become Louis ' wife , having previously been pledged to the younger Charles , and peace was secured for eight years , a remarkably long time ."

Heavily laden East Indiamen travelled from British Indian port cities such as Bombay or Calcutta to the United Kingdom carrying millions of pounds worth of goods . From Britain , the ships returned on the same routes , often carrying soldiers for the growing British Indian Army , then under the control of the Honourable East India Company ( HEIC ) . Following the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 , the British Admiralty had made the security of these routes a priority , and by 1807 the Dutch bases at the Cape of Good Hope and Java had been neutralised by expeditionary forces to prevent their use by enemy raiders . The French Indian Ocean possessions however , principally Île Bonaparte and Isle de France , were a more complicated target , protected from attack not only by the great distances involved in preparing an invasion attempt but also by heavy fortifications and a substantial garrison of French Army soldiers augmented by a large local militia ."

Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s .

Problems associated with ash loading are similar to that of snow ; however , ash is more severe as 1 ) the load from ash is generally much greater , 2 ) ash does not melt and 3 ) ash can clog and damage gutters , especially after rain fall . Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction , including roof slope , construction materials , roof span and support system , and age and maintenance of the building . Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs . Roofs made of smooth materials ( sheet metal or glass ) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials ( thatch , asphalt or wood shingles ) .

Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light , although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights . Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time : two complex lights ( composed of more than one monochromatic light ) could look alike but be physically different , called metameres . Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes , which he proposed to be threefold , the trichromatic color theory . Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young 's theory . Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights ( in fact , by any set of three different lights ) .

Generally , Scotto – English relations were relatively amiable and an extension of the truce until 1436 helped the English cause in France and the promises made in 1428 of a Scottish army to help Charles VII and the marriage of James 's eldest daughter to the French king 's son Louis were unrealised . James had to balance his European responses carefully – England 's ally , the Duke of Burgundy whose possessions included Scotland 's major trading partners , the Low Countries , ensured support for France would be muted . The truce with England expired in May 1436 but James 's perception of the Anglo @-@ French conflict changed following a realignment of the combatants . The breakdown of the talks between England and France in 1435 precipitated an alliance between Burgundy and France and a request from France for Scottish involvement in the war and for the fulfilment of the promised marriage of Princess Margaret to the Dauphin . In the spring of 1436 Princess Margaret sailed to France and in August Scotland entered the war with James leading a large army to lay siege to the English enclave of Roxburgh Castle . The campaign was to prove pivotal , the Book of Pluscarden describes ' a detestable split and most unworthy difference arising from jealosy ' within the Scottish camp and the historian Michael Brown explains that a contemporary source has James appointing his young and inexperienced cousin Robert Stewart of Atholl as the constable of the host ahead of the experienced march wardens , the earls of Douglas and Angus . Brown explains that both earls possessed considerable local interests and that the effects of such a large army living off the land may have created considerable resentment and hostility in the area . When the militant prelates of York and Durham together with the Earl of Northumberland took their forces into the marches to relieve the fortress , the Scots swiftly retreated — a chronicle written a year later said that the Scots ' had fled wretchedly and ignominiously ' — but the effects and the manner of the defeat and the loss of their expensive artillery was a major reversal for James both in terms of foreign policy and internal authority ."

As the Italian nationalist armies advanced through the peninsula , the fall of Rome seemed imminent . In September 1860 the Alliance Israélite Universelle wrote to Momolo offering him financial and logistical support if he wished to reclaim his son by force , as \" getting your child back is the cause of all Israel \" . A separate plan was formulated by Carl Blumenthal , an English Jew serving in Giuseppe Garibaldi 's nationalist volunteer corps : Blumenthal and three others would dress up as clergymen , seize Edgardo and spirit him away . Garibaldi approved this plan in 1860 , but it was apparently called off after one of the conspirators died ."

The herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich , past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey , where it climbed the Quantocks along the line of the current Stowey road , to Crowcombe Park Gate . Then it went south along the ridge , to Triscombe Stone . One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill , back to Alfred 's base at Athelney . The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe , then along the avenue to Red Post Cross , and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor . There is some evidence that an area of the hills known as Quantock Common may have been a Saxon Royal Forest ."

There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins . Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive , as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize . A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are used to determine the mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory ."

However , Sly Stone , the group 's creative head and multi @-@ instrumentalist , missed several recording deadlines , worrying CBS executive Clive Davis , and a Greatest Hits album was released in an eighteen @-@ month stretch during which the band released no new material . Relationships within the band were deteriorating , with friction between the Stone brothers and bassist Larry Graham . Epic executives requested more product , and the Black Panther Party , with which Stone had become associated , was demanding he make his music more militant and reflective of the black power movement , that he replace Greg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists , and replace manager David Kapralik . After moving to Los Angeles , California in late 1969 Stone and his bandmates began to use cocaine and PCP heavily rather than recording music . During this time Sly & the Family Stone released only one single , \" Thank You ( Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin ) \" / \" Everybody Is a Star \" , issued in December 1969 . Although \" Star \" was a positive song in the vein of their previous hit \" Everyday People \" ( 1968 ) , \" Thank You \" featured a darker political theme ."

Unlike animal joints , which have a limited range of motion , a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be \" unwound \" . As such , a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates ( or if the axle and wheel are fixed together , the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism ) ."

Further , he claimed that Adair had ordered Davis to New Orleans to obtain weapons knowing that the arms had already been taken by other brigades under Adair 's command . Either Adair had given a foolish order , or he did not have as many men in his main force as he claimed . He closed by promising that this would be his last statement on the matter . Adair 's October 29 , 1817 , response was delayed , he said , because he was awaiting documents from New Orleans that never came .

Verlaine and Lloyd 's dual playing on the record strongly influenced alternative rock groups such as the Pixies , noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth , and big arena bands like U2 .

As a member of U2 , Irish guitarist The Edge simulated Television 's guitar sound with an effects pedal . He later said he had wanted to \" sound like them \" and that Marquee Moon 's title track had changed his \" way of thinking about the guitar \" . Verlaine 's jagged , expressive sound on the album made a great impression on American guitarist John Frusciante when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s , as it reminded him that \" none of those things that are happening in the physical dimension mean anything , whether it 's what kind of guitar you play or how your amp 's set up .
