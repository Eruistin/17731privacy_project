    "text": "Saints were believed to have an active power after death , and the reformers made great efforts to transfer saints ' remains and relics from obscure minsters to their own new establishments . Characteristically , Æthelwold showed great energy in this . Gifts of land and other possessions to a church were often expressed as donations to its principal saint , so the seizure of such a saint 's remains from an unreformed community could then justify the transfer of its wealth to a Benedictine monastery , on the ground that as property had been donated to the saint , it should follow his or her body to its new home . The reformers had what Alan Thacker calls a \" mania for saint @-@ making and relic collecting \" . Theft of relics from unreformed communities to increase a church 's collection was common , such as Ely Abbey 's \" relic raid \" on Dereham in 974 to obtain the remains of Saint Wihtburg . This was probably associated with the acquisition by Ely of Dereham church , and may have been a means of ensuring that the abbey kept possession of the church 's estates . According to Thacker , Æthelwold 's activities were \" on an unrivalled scale \" :"

The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages , which increased England 's chances of saving the game . Just ten minutes after the start of the day 's play , heavy rain intervened . The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively , having advanced Australia to 409 / 4 . Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air ; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare , but dropped the catch . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 66 runs . During this time , the third new ball became available , but England opted not to use it immediately , as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence ; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball . However , after a period of using his slower bowlers , Yardley opted to take the new ball , and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50 , and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring . It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration , both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor . Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly , and drove Bedser for many runs . Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment , but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so , as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball ; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times ."

She even compared him to Frederick the Great , the 18th @-@ century King of Prussia . Others were appalled at the scale of the executions and at the relative complacency of many of their fellow Germans . \" A very calm and easy going mailman , \" the diarist Victor Klemperer wrote , \" who is not at all National Socialist , said , ' Well , he simply sentenced them . ' \" It did not escape Klemperer 's notice that many of the victims had played a role in bringing Hitler to power . \" A chancellor \" , he wrote , \" sentences and shoots members of his own private army ! \" The extent of the massacre and the relative ubiquity of the Gestapo , however , meant that those who disapproved of the purge generally kept quiet about it . Among the few exceptions were General Kurt von Hammerstein @-@ Equord and Field Marshal August von Mackensen , who started a campaign to have Schleicher rehabilitated by Hitler .

Besides working for the rehabilitation of Schleicher and Bredow , Hammerstein and Mackensen sent a memo to Hindenburg on July 18 setting out in considerable detail the circumstances of the murders of the two generals and noted that Papen had barely escaped . The memo went on to demand that Hindenburg punish those responsible , and criticised Blomberg for his outspoken support of the murders of Schleicher and Bredow . Finally , Hammerstein and Mackensen asked that Hindenburg reorganise the government by firing Baron Konstantin von Neurath , Robert Ley , Hermann Göring , Werner von Blomberg , Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darré from the Cabinet . Instead , the memo asked that Hindenburg create a directorate to rule Germany comprising the Chancellor ( who was not named ) , General Werner von Fritsch as Vice @-@ Chancellor , Hammerstein as Minister of Defense , the Minister for National Economy ( also unnamed ) and Rudolf Nadolny as Foreign Minister . The request that Neurath be replaced by Nadolny , the former Ambassador to Moscow who had resigned earlier that year in protest against Hitler 's anti @-@ Soviet foreign policy , indicated that Hammerstein and Mackensen wanted a return to the \" distant friendliness \" towards the Soviet Union that existed until 1933 .

The contest winners Koichi Nakamura and Yukinobu Chida , together with Horii , released the Enix NES game The Portopia Serial Murder Case .

Horii wanted to introduce the concept of RPGs to the wider Japanese video game audience .

He says it took him five minutes to compose the original opening theme . His musical motifs from the first game have remained relatively intact ."

The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri .

Following the 1995 destruction by fire of Ambohimanga 's sister rova at Antananarivo , widely believed to have been a politically motivated arson , rumors have circulated that Ambohimanga could suffer a similar fate . Cyclone Giovanna , which passed over Madagascar in February 2012 , caused considerable damage at the site . The wooden shingles of Andrianampoinimerina 's house were torn off by the wind , exposing the historic objects inside to damage from the elements . The wooden fence surrounding the Mahandrihono compound was also badly damaged . Worst affected are the plants and trees at the site . Large swaths of endemic medicinal plants and trees in the forest were destroyed . Many of the sacred trees shading the royal city were uprooted , including sacred fig trees around the Fidasiana courtyard and inside the zebu pen . Two of the uprooted trees were of particular symbolic significance , having served as physical anchors for certain royal rituals since the 17th century . Shortly after the storm , OSCAR unveiled plans to plant a substitute fig for the uprooted one that had shaded the sacred stone in the Fidasiana courtyard . Most of the historic jacarandas planted over a century ago under French colonial rule were also destroyed . The extent of damage to the site has prompted traditionalists to demand renewed respect for the sanctity of the site by requesting adherence to traditional taboos put in place by Merina monarchs .

This showed that the rear fuselage , wings and tail needed to be reinforced , and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well . These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946 . Manufacturer 's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August , after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice , and the first flight was made on 11 September ."

    "text": "Livermorium is projected to be the fourth member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 16 ( VIA ) in the Periodic Table , below polonium . While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements , its chemistry is expected to be quite similar to that of polonium . The group oxidation state of + 6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which lacks available d @-@ orbitals for expansion of its octet and is itself one of the strongest oxidizing agents among the chemical elements . Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum + 2 state , exhibited in the fluoride OF2 . The + 4 state is known for sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium , undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur ( IV ) and selenium ( IV ) through being the most stable state for tellurium ( IV ) to being oxidizing in polonium ( IV ) . This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects , especially the inert pair effect . The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be + 2 , with a rather unstable + 4 state . The + 2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium , and the + 4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands , such as in livermorium ( IV ) fluoride ( LvF4 ) . The + 6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons , making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons . The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a − 2 state as oxide , sulfide , selenide , telluride , and polonide ; due to the destabilization of livermorium 's 7p3 / 2 subshell , the − 2 state should be very unstable for livermorium , whose chemistry should be essentially cationic , though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should stabilize Lv2 − slightly ."

After the Civil War , J.

This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods . Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car , which preserved foods even better . For much of the 19th century , the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines , which was a problem when the ice was continually melting ; by the 1860s , refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process ."

Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a \" sophisticated , worldly experience \" , and was considered to be more of an adult than the rest of the cast . Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois , specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of \" nervous energy \" from trying to \" find herself \" , the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role . The actress also relates to Lois 's sassy , and independent nature , but , conversely , she is not as extroverted as Lois . Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks ; she is street smart , and a very capable woman . Durance believes her character is \" fiercely independent \" , but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws , and she is only human ; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws . She goes into further detail , identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable , with Gough adding that she is also \" slightly neurotic \" . BuddyTV 's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast @-@ talking woman , who , though she whines over petty annoyances , can take care of herself .

The French intercession eventually repelled the Merina , allowing the king to reestablish the capital at Ambatoharaña , but more than 40 years passed before the entire Antankarana had permanently returned to the mainland .

Both the skull and the lower jaw had fenestrae ( skull openings ) which reduced the weight of the skull .

Some members of the Umma Party wore Cuban military fatigues and beards in the style of Fidel Castro , which was taken as an indication of Cuban support for the revolution . However this practice was started by those members who had staffed a ZNP branch office in Cuba and it became a common means of dress amongst opposition party members in the months leading up to the revolution . The new Zanzibar government 's recognition of the German Democratic Republic ( the first African government to do so ) , and of North Korea , was further evidence to the Western Powers that Zanzibar was aligning itself closely with the communist bloc . Just six days after the revolution the New York Times stated that Zanzibar was \" on the verge of becoming the Cuba of Africa \" , but on 26 January denied that there was active communist involvement .

Together with the Familia he tried to reform the ineffective government , reducing the powers of the hetmans ( Commonwealth 's top military commanders ) and treasurers , moving them to commissions elected by the Sejm and responsible to the king . In his memoirs , Poniatowski called this period the \" years of hope . \" The Familia , which was interested in strengthening the power of their own faction , was dissatisfied with his conciliatory policy as he reached out to many former opponents of their policies . This uneasy alliance between Poniatowski and the Familia continued for most of the first decade of his rule . One of the points of contention between Poniatowski and the Familia concerned the rights of the religious minorities in Poland ; whereas Poniatowski reluctantly supported a policy of religious tolerance , the Familia was opposed to it . The growing rift between Poniatowski and the Familia was exploited by the Russians , who used this issue as a pretext to intervene in the Commonwealth 's internal politics and destabilize the country .

Dunbar , who was friendly with the Wentworths , was also the king 's surveyor , responsible for identifying trees suitable for use as ship masts and ensuring no illegal logging was taking place on ungranted lands in all of northern New England . This work was in opposition to a significant number of Belcher 's supporters , who engaged in illegal logging on those lands , behavior explicitly countenanced by the governor . Belcher took all steps possible to ensure Dunbar could not exercise any significant powers , refusing to seat him on the council , and making frequent trips from Boston to Portsmouth to exercise his authority personally . The two men disliked one another , and Dunbar began moving supporters in London to lobby for Belcher 's replacement not long after his appointment in 1731 . The illegal logging activity by Belcher 's allies eventually came to the attention of William Shirley , the crown advocate of the provincial admiralty court whose patron was the powerful Duke of Newcastle ."

Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks , rather than beaks . Stegosaurian teeth were small , triangular , and flat ; wear facets show that they did grind their food .

In Watchtower articles Rutherford was similarly scathing towards big business , politics and the League of Nations . Rogerson describes Rutherford 's attitude towards the clergy — his avowed enemies — as \" unadulterated hatred \" . His attacks on clergymen , particularly those of the Catholic Church , from the late 1920s were strong enough to attract a ban on his broadcasts by the NBC radio network , which condemned his \" rabid attack upon organized religion and the clergy \" . He also applied criticizing terms to those who had deserted Watch Tower ranks , calling them the \" evil servant \" . He urged readers to view with contempt anyone who had \" openly rebelled against God 's order or commandments \" and also described elective elders of the 1930s who refused to submit to Watch Tower Society administrative changes as \" despicable \" ."

As tensions grew across Europe in the first half of 1914 , German naval intelligence – the Nachrichten @-@ Abteilung , or \" N \" – set out to recruit potential agents . Lody already had links with the service . During his time with the Imperial German Navy , Lody had served under Arthur Tapken , who later became N 's first director . The German Imperial Admiralty Staff , or Admiralstab , listed Lody as a possible recruitment target before the outbreak of war . The naval authorities regarded Hamburg America Line ( HAL ) employees such as Lody as ideal recruits because of their expertise in naval matters and presence in ports worldwide . The HAL had collaborated with the Admiralstab since the 1890s . The relationship became so close that in July 1914 , just before the outbreak of the war , the HAL 's director Albert Ballin told the Admiralstab that he would \" place myself and the organisation subordinate to me at your Excellency 's disposal as best as possible . \""

An ecosystem 's area can vary greatly , from tiny to vast . A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem , but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it . Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf . Each of those aphids , in turn , support diverse bacterial communities . The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation , because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole .

Daniel Parente cited Limbo , Braid , and Patapon as influences for the game 's aesthetics . Comics and cartoons served as influences for Spidy 's design . The character was given a pair of large yellow eyes , which allowed the character to emote . Two of the legs were removed , bringing the total from eight to six , which Andrew McKerrow described as an effort to avoid triggering the fears of people with arachnophobia and \" make the character a little more friendly looking and little less creepy \" . It was only after making these changes to Spidy that the developers decided to make Spidy an extraterrestrial , as that would justify the character design 's deviations from regular spiders ."

    "text": "The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field . A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force , and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work . The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point . It is usually measured in volts , and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity . This definition of potential , while formal , has little practical application , and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference , and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points . An electric field has the special property that it is conservative , which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant : all paths between two specified points expend the same energy , and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated . The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage ."

That year , the squadron carried Queen Elizabeth II for the first time . In October 1964 , two second @-@ hand Vickers Viscount turboprop transports were obtained to supplement the Dakotas and Convairs ; the two piston @-@ engine types were withdrawn after the delivery of two Hawker Siddeley HS 748s beginning in April 1967 and three Dassault Falcon 20 jets ( known as Mystere in RAAF service ) in June . Two BAC 1 @-@ 11 jets joined the squadron on 19 January 1968 , and the two Viscounts were retired in March the following year . The wholesale re @-@ equipment of the VIP fleet in the late 1960s was controversial , and questions were raised in Parliament regarding its cost and operations . The so @-@ called \" VIP affair \" led to more stringent guidelines governing No. 34 Squadron 's tasking , requiring approval for flights to be made by the British Royal Family , the Governor @-@ General , the Prime Minister , or the Minister for Air . Eligibility criteria were also codified , and potential passengers included Federal ministers , opposition leaders , \" individuals of similar status and importance visiting Australia \" , two @-@ star officers and above , and other dignitaries of similar status . During the 1970s one of No. 34 Squadron 's BAC 1 @-@ 11s experienced an engine failure over the Tasman Sea while carrying Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to New Zealand . The aircraft made a safe landing in Australia , but the incident led the RAAF to investigate using three- or four @-@ engined aircraft for future VIP flights involving long over @-@ water legs . The government eventually purchased two Boeing 707s from Qantas to perform long @-@ range VIP flights and to improve the RAAF 's strategic transport capabilities . Entering service in 1979 , they joined the newly established No. 33 Flight ( later No. 33 Squadron ) in 1981 .

He disagreed with Hobbes that a layman could understand the law , saying that \" he that hath been educated in the study of the law hath a great advantage over those that have been otherwise exercised \" . The distinction between Coke and Hale is that Hale agreed with Selden that law was created through agreement , and disagreed that reason had an inherent binding power .

Troops from Béxar were excused from the front lines , so that they would not be forced to fight their families and friends . In the initial moments of the assault the Mexican troops were at a disadvantage . Although their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely , inexperienced recruits in the back also discharged their weapons ; many Mexican soldiers were unintentionally killed by their own comrades . As Mexican soldiers swarmed over the walls , at least 80 Texians fled the Alamo and were cut down by Mexican cavalry . Within an hour , almost all of the Texian defenders , estimated at 182 – 257 men , were killed . Between four and seven Texians , possibly including Crockett , surrendered . Although General Manuel Fernández Castrillón attempted to intercede on their behalf , Santa Anna insisted that the prisoners be executed immediately ."

The curriculum that should be covered by such programs has been the subject of much discussion . Patient care , medical knowledge , practice @-@ based learning , communication skills , professionalism , and system @-@ based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education , but the application of these goals can take many forms . The breadth of skills needed in international emergency medicine make it unlikely that one standardized program could fulfill the training needs for every scenario . One Australian study found that the primary topics covered by U.S. fellowship programs were emergency medicine systems development , humanitarian relief , disaster management , public health , travel and field medicine , program administration , and academic skills . Its authors argue that attempting to cover all of those areas may be unrealistic and that a more targeted focus on acquiring necessary skills might be more productive ."

The cantata is based on the hymn in 13 stanzas by Michael Franck ( 1652 ) , to a melody by Johann Crüger ( 1661 ) , \" a meditation on the transience of human life and of all earthly goods \" .

Saloth and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing at the same time but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Saloth or allowed the two men to meet . Shortly after , Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge . In doing so , Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control .

However , this quantity varies significantly across space and time , particularly within the seasonal cycle , spanning a range of 0 – 100 m / s . This variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( <formula> ) as well as in the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere , which are controlled by the large @-@ scale dynamics of the tropical climate . These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature ( and underlying ocean dynamics ) , background near @-@ surface wind speed , and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating .

She disliked fairy tales because they endorsed an irrational view of the world and success without work . Trimmer 's view of fairy tales , although often ridiculed by modern critics , was widespread at the end of the eighteenth century , in part because most educators accepted John Locke 's theory that the mind was a tabula rasa and therefore particularly sensitive to impressions early in life . Trimmer was opposed to fairy tales that were not grounded in reality and which would \" excite an unregulated sensibility \" in the reader . Without a proper moral or a moralizing narrator , fairy tales could lead a reader astray . Above all , she was concerned about \" unmediated \" , unknown , and unsupervised feelings in the child reader . One of the reasons Trimmer believed fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences . She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections , complaining that \" little children , whose minds are susceptible of every impression ; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy \" should not be allowed to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife 's head off ."

The rabbis also suggest that Joseph instructed his brothers to bury him in Shechem since it was from there he was taken and sold into slavery . Other Jewish sources have him buried either in Safed , or , according to an aggadic tradition , have him interred at Hebron according to his own wishes . The ambiguity is reflected in Islamic tradition which points to Nablus as being the authentic site , though some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb . The Qur 'an itself does not mention details of Joseph 's burial . Ali of Herat ( 1119 ) , Yaqut ( 1229 ) and Ibn Battuta ( 1369 ) all conserve both the Nablus and Hebron traditions .

Due to numerous shifts in those maintaining the code ( due to other obligations ) , and the number of potential user suggestions to include , Angband would become highly forked , leading to a number of Angband variants ; at least sixty known variants exist with about a half dozen still under active development . One significant fork was ZAngband ( 1994 ) ( short for Zelazny Angband ) , which expanded on Angband and altered the theme towards Roger Zelazny 's The Chronicles of Amber . The ZAngband codebase would be used to create Tales of Middle Earth ( TOME ) in 2002 , which later swapped out the Tolkien and Zelazny fiction setting for a new original one to become Tales of Maj 'Eyal ( 2009 ) . The vanilla Angband remains in development today by the devteam ."

Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government . Most of the vacancies occurred in the south @-@ west of Scotland , an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies . Abandoning the official church , many of the people here began to attend illegal field assemblies led by excluded ministers , known as conventicles . They became known after one of their leaders as the Cameronians . Official attempts to suppress these led to a rising in 1679 , defeated by James , Duke of Monmouth , the King 's illegitimate son , at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge . In the early 1680s a more intense phase of persecution began , in what was later to be known in Protestant historiography as \" the Killing Time \" , with dissenters summarily executed by the dragoons of James Graham , Laird of Claverhouse or sentenced to transportation or death by Sir George Mackenzie , the Lord Advocate ."

The Byzantine navy suffered great losses , with the thematic fleets in particular being devastated , while the land forces suffered comparatively few casualties .

The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship of the Games . Despite Brundage 's strenuous resistance the commercialisation of the Games continued during the 1960s , and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC 's coffers . By the Grenoble Games , Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that , if it could not be corrected , he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished . Brundage 's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities , and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals . When Brundage retired the IOC had $ 2 million in assets ; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $ 45 million . This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members , towards expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights ."

In 1858 , the Committee on Commerce of the United States House of Representatives conducted an investigation to decide if the Rock Island Bridge was a serious obstruction to the navigation of the river . The committee concluded that the bridge was a hazard because of the length of the pier , the angle of the bridge , and the swift current under the bridge . The committee believed , however , that the courts should settle the matter and therefore did not recommend any action by the United States Congress . In May 1858 , Ward filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa asking the court to declare the bridge a nuisance and order its removal and restore the river to its original capacity for all purposes of navigation . The judge declared the bridge a nuisance and ordered the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad to remove the three piers and their superstructure that lay on the Iowa side . The judge reasoned that if this bridge was not stopped , many other bridges would follow . The piers were not torn out , because the railroad company appealed the case to the United States Supreme Court .

    "text": "Chapter six addresses the use of animals in entertainment . Cochrane does not oppose the practice of pet @-@ keeping , and accepts that humans do have an interest in being able to keep pets , but that this interest is not so strong that it can be satisfied at any cost . He argues that pet @-@ keeping should be regulated far more than it is , perhaps through the need for a license , the granting of which would be dependent on individuals proving their ability to care for the animal 's well @-@ being . Cochrane is open to euthanizing pets , but only in cases when medical care could not give them a chance at further good experiences . In these cases , providing medical care would be necessary ( pet insurance could be a requirement for a license ) . Neutering pets is argued to be neither a violation of their rights nor a requirement , but anyone who does not have their pets neutered would be required to ensure the wellbeing of any offspring . The same requirements as were established in the chapter on genetic engineering are applied to animal breeding , and Cochrane accepts that this may lead to the extinction of certain breeds . Concerning zoos and circuses , Cochrane argues that animals do not possess a right not to be kept or displayed , but they do possess a right not to be made to suffer . This imposes limitations on the kinds of animals which can be kept ( for instance , large animals could not realistically be kept by traveling circuses ) , the conditions in which they are kept , and the nature of their performances . Hunting , cockfighting , dogfighting , bear baiting and bullfighting are condemned , as is , after some consideration , fishing . Cochrane is potentially open to greyhound and horse racing , or equestrianism generally , but says that \" the way that these sports are currently organized and practiced does involve the routine suffering and death of animals and ought to be condemned as such . \" Such practices include suffering caused during training and racing , and the killing of animals past their peak or who do not display the requisite skills . Before concluding the chapter , Cochrane considers , but rejects , three possible objections to any use of animals in entertainment : first , by appeal to a concept of dignity , which use of the animals undermines ; second , an appeal to disrespect , whether or not harm is caused ; and third , that the use of animals in entertainment implies ownership , and animals have a right not to be considered property ."

The convention then adjourned until Monday , June 25 . With almost two days for intrigue , rumors swept through the convention that Blaine would be a candidate after all . Late on Saturday night , Foraker released a statement that he would support Blaine . Walters proffered several reasons for the switch : Foraker felt Sherman had no chance , resented not being thanked by Sherman for the seconding speech , and was annoyed at the trickle of votes McKinley had received , feeling that the congressman was being prepared as a backup candidate for the Sherman forces . There was also talk that Foraker might gain a place on the ticket , either for president or vice president , though he stated he would not accept a nomination without Sherman 's consent . The switch wounded Sherman 's candidacy by showing that his own state 's governor did not support him , and even though Foraker switched back to Sherman when Blaine wired reiterating that he was not a candidate , the damage was done ; Harrison gained the nomination on the eighth ballot ."

The Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad opened a branch ( later the Marysvale Branch ) from its main line at Thistle to Manti in 1890 , and extended it ( through a subsidiary , the Sevier Railway ) , to Salina in 1891 , Belknap in 1896 , and Marysvale in 1900 . No rail line ever reached farther south , and so residents of towns such as Junction , Panguitch , Alton , Glendale , and Kanab had to travel north to the railhead at Marysvale . The old county road through Circleville Canyon was poorly constructed , with steep grades and a rough surface . The State Road Commission designated the highway from Nephi east through Salt Creek Canyon and then south through these valleys to Kanab as a state road in or soon after 1910 . Initially the route from the summit at Long Valley Junction to Kanab went through Alton and Johnson Canyon , entering Kanab from the east . A more direct route via Long Valley was considered , serving the communities of Glendale , Orderville , and Mt . Carmel , but this would have required difficult construction over a mesa covered in loose sand to reach Kanab . In summer 1912 , the commission added a branch from Long Valley Junction to Mt .

Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies . Flanged males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls . Those calls may also suppress development in younger males . Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one , will force copulation on her . While both strategies are successful , females prefer to mate with flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males . Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days , weeks or months after copulation ."

A possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results is given in a series of papers by Getty , who shows that Grafen ’ s proof of the handicap principle is based on the critical simplifying assumption that signallers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion , the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency . But the assumption that costs and benefits trade off in an additive fashion is not valid for the survival cost – reproduction benefit tradeoff that is assumed to mediate the evolution of sexually selected signals . Fitness depends on producing offspring , which is a multiplicative function of reproductive success given an individual is still alive times the probability of still being alive , given investment in signals ."

Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) associated with viral infections such as polio , measles , mumps and rubella . Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live @-@ attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live @-@ attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated ."

Modern @-@ day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms . In many cases , the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path . Judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships , and their location in relation to the storm , it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm 's center of circulation for a given point in time . This is the manner in which three of the eight known storms in the 1861 season were identified by hurricane expert José Fernández Partagás 's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910 . Partagás also extended the known tracks of most of the other tropical cyclones previously identified by scholars . The information Partagás and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database ( HURDAT ) , with some slight adjustments . HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity , although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed , listings on some storms are incomplete ."

By circa 1988 , however , the genre had merged into other forms of European dance and electronic music , one of which was Italo house .

This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage . The work was well received , and Handel was appointed resident composer for the theatre , but losses continued , and Swiney fled abroad to escape his creditors . John James Heidegger took over the management of the theatre and , from 1719 , began to extend the stage through arches into the houses to the south of the theatre . A \" Royal Academy of Music \" was formed by subscription from wealthy sponsors , including the Prince of Wales , to support Handel 's productions at the theatre .

The growth of the human population in the Eurasian Arctic in the 16th and 17th century , together with the advent of firearms and increasing trade , dramatically increased the harvest of polar bears . However , since polar bear fur has always played a marginal commercial role , data on the historical harvest is fragmentary .

James pardoned Frances and commuted Carr 's sentence of death , eventually pardoning him in 1624 . The implication of the King in such a scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished James 's court with an image of corruption and depravity . The subsequent downfall of the Howards left Villiers unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1619 ."

The initial change was to increase the carriers ' speed to no less than 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) which required the addition of a fourth steam turbine and associated propeller shaft . Offsetting the additional weight of the machinery meant reductions in armour thicknesses in the hangar deck and the bulkheads at the ends of the hangar . At the same time the Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) was developing a different modified Illustrious design ( Design D ) to carry an additional dozen aircraft ( a total of 48 ) in a lower hangar that also incorporated the additional machinery of the initial design with the sacrifice of even more armour . Hangar height was initially planned as 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) in the upper hangar to accommodate the new Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) in the lower hangar to accommodate taller amphibious aircraft , but a later change in policy raised the upper hangar height to 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) .

The second is that it has lacked consistency in how it has represented women , especially during its early years . Another problem facing the ACWF is its relationship with the international women ’ s movement . The relationship between the Marxist view of feminism and current international views on feminism are often viewed as contradictory . Marxism often labels feminist movements as bourgeois because it focuses on the betterment of only one segment of society instead of society as a whole , and states capitalism , not the patriarchy , is the creator of gender inequality .

The virus particle is 80 – 120 nanometers in diameter and usually roughly spherical , although filamentous forms can occur . These filamentous forms are more common in influenza C , which can form cordlike structures up to 500 micrometers long on the surfaces of infected cells . However , despite these varied shapes , the viral particles of all influenza viruses are similar in composition . These are made of a viral envelope containing two main types of glycoproteins , wrapped around a central core . The central core contains the viral RNA genome and other viral proteins that package and protect this RNA . RNA tends to be single stranded but in special cases it is double . Unusually for a virus , its genome is not a single piece of nucleic acid ; instead , it contains seven or eight pieces of segmented negative @-@ sense RNA , each piece of RNA containing either one or two genes , which code for a gene product ( protein ) .

This was at the invitation of Earl Harold Godwinson of Wessex . The chronicle of Waltham Abbey states that Cynesige did the consecration because the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant . However , there was an occupant of Canterbury , Stigand , but his election to Canterbury was not considered canonical by the papacy , and Harold may have excluded him because of concerns about Stigand 's canonical status ."

Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to suffer pain , though several leading researchers , including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US , believe scratching in SM cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine . If onset is at an early age , a first sign may be scratching and / or rapidly appearing scoliosis . If the problem is severe , there is likely to be poor proprioception ( awareness of body position ) , especially with regard to the forelimbs . Clumsiness and falling results from this problem . Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition ."

This led him to reconsider his position on religion — previously an agnostic , his interest in Christianity was renewed , and having read the Bible , the works of the theologian William Paley as well as more skeptical works such as Hume 's On Miracles , he came to acknowledge the \" moral truth \" of the gospels , while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity . Despite this personal tragedy , and his own continued ill health , Prescott had gathered sufficient material to begin drafting the History in October 1829 . At around this time , Prescott read the works of Gabriel Bonnot de Mably , including his historiographical piece De l ’ étude de l ’ histoire . He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably 's romantic ideal , and on more than one occasion expressed his indebtedness to him . Prescott also encountered Elogia de la Réina Doña Isabel , by his Spanish contemporary Diego Clemencín , which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs ' political roles . Due to further problems with his eyesight , it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the History . It was largely finished by 1834 , but Prescott dedicated two years to abridging and redrafting it . He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of Charles Brockden Brown for Jared Sparks ' Library of American Biography . Prescott was not familiar with American literature , and he based the work on other contemporary biographies of Brown . As a result , the biography has had little academic impact . In 1835 , he took residence in the rural town of Nahant , Massachusetts , due to concerns about his health . He was here accustomed to riding his horses for the purpose of exercise , and he persevered even in sub @-@ zero temperatures . Prescott finished the concluding chapter of the work in July 1836 , and despite the amount of time and effort which he had spent on the work , was at first unsure about publishing it .

Prescott had previously considered publishing the work in London first , and therefore a printed draft copy of the work was sent to a Colonel Aspinwall for consideration .

    "text": "The three known Ankylosaurus skulls differ in various details , but this is thought to be the result of taphonomy ( changes happening during fossilisation of the remains ) and individual variation . The skull was low and triangular in shape , wider than it was long . It had a broad beak on the premaxillae . The orbits ( eye sockets ) were almost round to slightly oval and did not face directly sideways , because the skull tapered towards the front . Crests above the orbits merged into the upper squamosal horns ( their shape has been described as \" pyramidal \" ) , which pointed backwards to the sides from the back of the skull . The crest and horn were probably separate elements originally , as seen in the related Pinacosaurus and Euoplocephalus . Below the upper horns , jugal horns were present , which pointed backwards and down . The horns may have originally been osteoderms ( armor plates ) that fused to the skull . However , the scale pattern on the skull surface was instead the result of remodelling of the skull . This obliterated the sutures between skull elements , which is common for adult ankylosaurs . The scale pattern of the skull was variable between specimens , though some details are shared ; it had a diamond @-@ shaped scale ( internarial scale ) at the font of the snout , two squamosal osteoderms above the orbit , and a ridge of scales at the back of the skull ."

There are no records of coyotes killing wolves , though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them .

He was promoted to air marshal and became Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) on 21 April 1982 , succeeding Air Marshal Sir Neville McNamara . As CAS , Evans took steps to enhance discipline , bearing and morale in the Air Force , demanding high personal standards . He sponsored the development of an Australian air power doctrine , eventually published as the Air Power Manual under one of his successors , Air Marshal Ray Funnell , in 1990 . Evans also commissioned a marching tune especially for the RAAF , later to be called \" Eagles of Australia \" , to replace the Royal Air Force march that had been in use previously . As early as 1969 , he had advocated permanently basing a squadron of fighter aircraft at RAAF Tindal in the Northern Territory . Tindal was one of a series of forward air bases initiated by Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger when he was CAS in 1959 , but a defence committee decision prior to Evans becoming CAS had determined to locate the RAAF 's northernmost fighter squadron at Darwin . His chance remark in mid @-@ 1982 to the new Minister of Defence , Ian Sinclair , regarding the suitability of Tindal over Darwin led to the former base being chosen as the home of No. 75 ( Fighter ) Squadron . Alan Stephens described the permanent manning of Tindal as having \" formalised the shift to the strategy of defence @-@ in @-@ depth — of defending Australia by controlling its air @-@ sea gap \" . Late in 1983 , Evans selected the site for the last of the Air Force 's northerly \" bare bases \" , RAAF Scherger , near Weipa on Cape York Peninsula .

He recounted his life in Geneva , sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered . Calvin died on 27 May 1564 aged 54 . At first his body was laid in state , but since so many people came to see it , the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint 's cult . On the following day , he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois .

The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation .

Among the factions competing for power in China , Townsend believes that none of them , neither the leaders nor their men , have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot . With every man only out for himself and \" China 's microscopically few good men ... too weak to be felt \" , Townsend predicts no end to the chaos . Much of the violence , Townsend explains in chapter eight , is fuelled by opium , the addiction of one out of every eight Chinese . Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies , to such an extent that many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food , and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade . In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords , in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China . The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal , brave , reliable , honest , and cleanly people , and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese . Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932 , which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression , and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the \" foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese \" waged by Zhang Xueliang . Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as \" a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there \" which has achieved \" stability and well @-@ being for millions \" . Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan 's role in dealing with an unruly China ."

The Earth @-@ induced component arises from libration , a result of the Moon 's orbital eccentricity ; if the Moon 's orbit were perfectly circular , there would only be solar tides . Libration also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen , allowing about 59 % of its surface to be seen from Earth ( but only half at any instant ) . The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes . Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than earthquakes , although they can last for up to an hour — a significantly longer time than terrestrial earthquakes — because of the absence of water to damp out the seismic vibrations . The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972 ."

Analysis of stomach contents reveal that pelagic threshers feed mainly on barracudinas , lightfishes , and escolars , all inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone . Therefore , little competition occurs between the pelagic thresher and other large oceanic piscivores such as billfishes , tunas , and dolphinfishes , which tend to feed near the surface . As in other threshers , pelagic threshers may swim in circles to drive schooling prey into a compact mass , before striking them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them . Because of this behavior , pelagic threshers are often hooked on longlines by their tails ."

After removing the historic Tsararay in the Mahandrihono compound , Andrianampoinimerina built a new house with the same name in the Bevato compound . Tsararay was the residence of his wives when they would make the journey to Ambohimanga . The Bevato compound in Antananarivo was likewise reserved for the sovereign 's wives under the reign of Andrianampoinimerina , but featured many more houses to enable each wife her own residence . When wives would travel to Ambohimanga they were obliged to share the houses , and those who preferred not to share typically stayed at the houses of villagers beyond the city walls ."

While walking along the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes between Girona and Bailén streets , he was struck by a passing tram and lost consciousness . Assumed to be a beggar because of his lack of identity documents and shabby clothing , the unconscious Gaudí did not receive immediate aid . Eventually a police officer transported him in a taxi to the Santa Creu Hospital , where he received rudimentary care . By the time that the chaplain of the Sagrada Família , Mosén Gil Parés , recognised him on the following day , Gaudí 's condition had deteriorated too severely to benefit from additional treatment . Gaudí died on 10 June 1926 at the age of 73 and was buried two days later . A large crowd gathered to bid farewell to him in the chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in the crypt of the Sagrada Família . His gravestone bears this inscription :"

However , Meg 's supervising animator Ken Duncan disagreed with Menken 's song because he believed that the character was simply \" too tough \" and \" hardened by life \" to perform such a soft ballad . The writers also agreed that Meg \" wasn ’ t a ballad kind of girl . \" Therefore , Menken was prompted to write \" I Won 't Say ( I 'm in Love ) \" , the style of which he based on girl group songs he had written for his musical Little Shop of Horrors , with which \" I Can 't Believe My Heart \" was ultimately replaced . Although she had liked the original song , actress and singer Susan Egan , who voices Meg , agreed that the much slower \" I Can 't Believe My Heart \" was not a suitable number for her character to perform because it was \" too straightforward and literal \" , whereas \" I Won 't Say ( I 'm in Love ) \" expresses a similar meaning , only \" the way Meg would — without admitting any of it . \""

Based on this , Adolf Soetbeer , secretary of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce , suggested in the Bremer Handelsblatt on 22 September 1866 that any planned flag should combine the colours of Prussia ( black and white ) with the Hanseatic colours ( red and white ) . In the following year , the constitution of the North German Confederation was enacted , where a horizontal black @-@ white @-@ red tricolour was declared to be both the civil and war ensign ."

After 633 the Northumbrian situation was stabilised under Oswald of Northumbria , and East Anglia shared with Northumbria the benefits of the Irish missions of Fursey and Aidan of Lindisfarne . Sigeberht was Fursey 's patron and perhaps soon after his arrival Sigeberht abdicated and retired to the monastery at Beodricesworth ( modern Bury St. Edmunds ) . His abdication , which cannot be dated , left Ecgric to rule the East Anglians alone . Ecgric therefore ruled a kingdom that had been \" evangelised in the united spirit of the Roman and Irish Churches \" , according to Plunkett , who notes that Felix would have respected the teachings of the Irish missionaries , despite his own strong allegiance towards Canterbury ."

According to the Gospel of Luke 2 : 1 – 20 , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem , wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger . By Holy Tradition , the manger was located in a cave near that town . An angel of the Lord appeared to a group of shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region , and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem . They went there and found the baby lying in the manger , as the angel described to them . By folk tradition , the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night . The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event ."

A gene is expressed when it is being transcribed into mRNA and there exist many cellular methods of controlling the expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when needed by the cell . Transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to DNA , either promoting or inhibiting the transcription of a gene . Within the genome of Escherichia coli bacteria , for example , there exists a series of genes necessary for the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan . However , when tryptophan is already available to the cell , these genes for tryptophan synthesis are no longer needed . The presence of tryptophan directly affects the activity of the genes — tryptophan molecules bind to the tryptophan repressor ( a transcription factor ) , changing the repressor 's structure such that the repressor binds to the genes . The tryptophan repressor blocks the transcription and expression of the genes , thereby creating negative feedback regulation of the tryptophan synthesis process ."

In 1955 a draft copy of a book , The Military History of the PVA , was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it . In the preface of the book it was stated that \" the military victories of the PVA \" were won \" under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong \" : Peng authorized the text after removing the phrase \" and of Comrade Mao Zedong \" . In 1956 an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng condemning the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao : Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng , his chief of staff , to be widely distributed . Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum , saying : \" why take the trouble to put it up ? What is put up now will be removed in the future . \" When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted \" Long Live Chairman Mao ! \" ( literally \" 10 @,@ 000 years for Chairman Mao \" ) , Peng addressed the soldiers , saying : \" You shout ' 10 @,@ 000 years for Chairman Mao ! ' – does he , then , live for 10 @,@ 000 years ? He will not even live for 100 years ! This is a personality cult ! \" When one of Peng 's political commissars suggested to him that the song The East is Red ( a song that idealizes Mao , which Mao later had sung in place of the Chinese national anthem during the Cultural Revolution ) be widely taught throughout the PLA , Peng angrily rejected the suggestion , saying \" That is a personality cult ! That is idealism ! \" Later in 1956 a group of soldiers visited Peng in order to request an audience with the Chairman , but Peng rejected them , saying : \" He is an old man , what is so beautiful about him ? \""

However , the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much , citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm , who had resisted US advice so often . It said \" The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor . It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state . \" The newspaper said if the answer was yes , then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities ."

In 1962 , against Brundage 's opposition , the IOC amended the rules to allow sports federations to offer athletes \" broken time \" payments , compensating them for time missed from work , but only if they had dependents in need . In 1972 , Brundage called for the elimination of the Winter Olympics after 1976 , finding them hopelessly polluted by rampant commercialism , especially in alpine skiing . In his final speech to the IOC in Munich in 1972 , Brundage maintained his position on amateurism : \" There are only two kinds of competitors . Those free and independent individuals who are interested in sports for sport 's sake , and those in sports for financial reasons . Olympic glory is for amateurs . \""

However , four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane ; two of them were related to heart attacks . Numerous people sustained injuries , largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts . Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $ 150 million . In the storm 's aftermath , a study of the hurricane 's effect on aquatic animals living in the swash zone ( the immediate area where land and the ocean meet ) of Panama City Beach was conducted . The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm , the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore . However , the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter . Also along the shore , the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers , including the total destruction of a 300 feet ( 91 m ) extension of the Okaloosa Island Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span . A fishing pier at St. Andrews State Park also suffered vast damage , along with another wooden pier at Mexico Beach and the M.B.

Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in A Perfect World ( 1993 ) and Mystic River ( 2003 ) . Changeling is a thematic companion piece to Mystic River , which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated , violent act against a child — a comparison with which Eastwood agreed . He said that showing a child in danger was \" about the highest form of drama you can have \" , as crimes against them were to him the most horrible . Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence . He said , \" When [ a crime ] comes along quite as big as this one , you question humanity . It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be . \" Samuel Blumenfeld of Le Monde said the scene featuring Northcott 's execution by hanging was \" unbearable \" due to its attention to detail ; he believed it one of the most convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable . Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment , Northcott was an ideal candidate , and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime . He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment , but that whether one were pro- or anti @-@ capital punishment , the barbarism of public executions must be recognized . Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims ' families , justice may be done , but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace . The scene 's realism was deliberate : the audience hears Northcott 's neck breaking , his body swings , and his feet shake . It was Eastwood 's intention to make it unbearable to watch ."

In such a scenario , the abundance of the isotope 3He , produced by solar rays splitting gases in the upper atmosphere , would be expected to decrease — and initial investigations did indeed find such a drop in 3He abundance . But the idea of an inclination effect has been deemed unnecessary ( Rial 1999 ) . However , there is still the possibility that the 100ka eccentricity cycle acts as a \" pacemaker \" to the system , amplifying the effect of precession and obliquity cycles at key moments , pushing the system out of a locally stable state and triggering a swift melting phase , by a small perturbation ."

Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed , and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half @-@ eaten . In addition , Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment ( which had been discontinued a year previously ) \" with good humour \" and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death , setting down , in fact , a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend . At the time , Turing 's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental , resulting from her son 's careless storage of laboratory chemicals . Biographer Andrew Hodges suggests that Turing may have arranged the cyanide experiment deliberately , to give his mother some plausible deniability ."

Some scholars have thought it unlikely that the forger invented this scheme , and therefore presumed that he copied enamel on the original that has been removed in the 19th century , probably because it was damaged — sections of enamel cannot be patched up , but must be removed completely and redone . However John Cherry believes this and other changes in the enamel of the Vienna version are elaborations by Weininger and his craftsmen ; for example in Vienna the wings of the trumpeting angels are coloured . The two figures are in a sophisticated \" soft and flowing \" International Gothic style executed with great virtuosity ; Michael 's staff is detached from the background over most of its length and is one of a number of elements that extend outside the frame of the door . If there was once enamel on the two figures it would have been at least mainly in more fragile translucent enamels , as the very fine working of many details of them was clearly intended to be seen . The rougher working of the surfaces at the bottom of the doors : the dragon below St Michael , the water below St Christopher , and the ground below both of these , suggests that the missing original enamels were opaque in these areas . But all the extra enamel in Vienna is opaque , including the saints ' figures , and the effect of the more intense colours is \" lurid \" and \" offends our eyes because of its crudity \" ."

Watanabe stayed as one of the game 's writers , with writer and novelist Emi Nagashima , better known under her pen name of Jun Eishima , coming on as a story consultant . Lightning 's outfit for the game was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo , who worked from a rough outline done by Nomura , who also designed the characters ' facial features .

For Lightning Returns , the developers decided to have Lightning as the sole protagonist so that players could get to know her better .

    "text": "Ferrocene , [ Fe ( C5H5 ) 2 ] , was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the fulvalene ( C10H8 ) by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene ; the resultant product was found to have molecular formula C10H10Fe and reported to exhibit \" remarkable stability \" . The discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry , in part because the structure proposed by Pauson and Kealy ( shown at right ) was inconsistent with then @-@ existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability . Consequently , the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood . The sandwich structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952 : Robert Burns Woodward and Geoffrey Wilkinson investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule ( such as benzene ) , Ernst Otto Fischer deduced the sandwich structure and also began synthesising other metallocenes including cobaltocene ; Eiland and Pepinsky provided X @-@ ray crystallographic confirmation of the sandwich structure . Applying valence bond theory to ferrocene by considering an Fe2 + centre and two cyclopentadienide anions ( C5H5 − ) , which are known to be aromatic according to Hückel 's rule and hence highly stable , allowed correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule . Once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied , the reasons for ferrocene 's remarkable stability became clear ."

Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development . The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software 's Quake series . Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments . Because QERadiant was a finished , functional tool , it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project 's start and then export them into the NOD engine , rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor .

Additionally , while M. l. leuconotus is considered of least concern by the IUCN due to its widespread occurrence , both island subspecies are considered vulnerable by the Australian government due to their delicate nesting sites that are easily disturbed by human construction and habitation ."

    "text": "Döblin wrote the novel between fall 1921 and summer 1923 . According to the author , the novel set out to explore the question : \" What will become of the human being if he keeps living like he lives now ? \" Döblin would later write that the original inspiration for the novel was the sight of pebbles rolling in the surf on the Baltic Sea coast during a family vacation in the summer of 1921 ; this epiphanic vision provoked a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in nature for Döblin , who began taking extensive notes in various Berlin museums and libraries on natural history and science , geology , geography , climatology , ethnography , and other fields . If he had originally conceived of the novel as a \" hymn to the city \" and to technology , as he got into the project it increasingly became an encomium to nature . In early 1922 he closed his medical practice for a month to further his research for the novel . The section on Iceland and Greenland , which occurs towards the end of the published novel , was one of the first sections Döblin envisioned and drafted , and an advance publication of this section appeared in the Vossische Zeitung on New Year 's Day 1922 with the title Die Enteisung Grönlands im Jahre 2500 . Das Zauberschiff ( The Melting of Greenland 's Ice in the Year 2500 : The Magical Ship ) . In May 1922 Döblin rented a villa in Zehlendorf to complete the draft of the novel , a setting explicitly referenced in the novel 's unusual \" Dedication \" . The exertions of drafting the novel provoked a sort of nervous breakdown : as he would later write , \" the fantasy was too wild and my brain would not release me . \" In a 2011 biography , Wilfried Schoeller has suggested that there was an additional reason for Döblin 's breakdown — namely , that the temporary move to Zehlendorf was also his unsuccessful attempt to leave his wife in favor of his lover Charlotte Niclas . According to Schoeller , this personal dimension left its mark on the novel , especially on the novel 's dedication ."

They depend on their body temperature being sufficiently high and since they cannot regulate it themselves , this is dependent on their environment . Butterflies living in cooler climates may use their wings to warm their bodies . They will bask in the sun , spreading out their wings so that they get maximum exposure to the sunlight . In hotter climates butterflies can easily overheat , so they are usually active only during the cooler parts of the day , early morning , late afternoon or early evening . During the heat of the day , they rest in the shade . Some larger thick @-@ bodied moths ( e.g. Sphingidae ) can generate their own heat to a limited degree by vibrating their wings . The heat generated by the flight muscles warms the thorax while the temperature of the abdomen is unimportant for flight .

    "text": "Languages differ widely in how much they rely on morphological processes of word formation . In some languages , for example , Chinese , there are no morphological processes , and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words . This type of morpho @-@ syntax is often called isolating , or analytic , because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning . Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes , but they vary in the degree to which morphemes are discrete units . In many languages , notably in most Indo @-@ European languages , single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments . For example , in Latin , the word bonus , or \" good \" , consists of the root bon- , meaning \" good \" , and the suffix -us , which indicates masculine gender , singular number , and nominative case . These languages are called fusional languages , because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme . The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains , but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit . An example of such a language is Turkish , where for example , the word evlerinizden , or \" from your houses \" , consists of the morphemes , ev @-@ ler @-@ iniz @-@ den with the meanings house @-@ plural @-@ your @-@ from . The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages . They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word . For example , in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh means I didn 't understand it consisting of morphemes na @-@ fahm @-@ id @-@ am @-@ esh with the meanings , \" negation.understand.past.I.it \" . As another example with more complexity , in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq , which means \" He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer \" , the word consists of the morphemes tuntu @-@ ssur @-@ qatar @-@ ni @-@ ksaite @-@ ngqiggte @-@ uq with the meanings , \" reindeer @-@ hunt @-@ future @-@ say @-@ negation @-@ again @-@ third.person.singular.indicative \" , and except for the morpheme tuntu ( \" reindeer \" ) none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation ."

The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until the advent of the state 's political parties . Once in power , a party could stack the government with its own members , making it difficult for the minority to regain power . Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities . For example , if a man was to divorce his wife , the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry ."

The Romans established several towns in Kent including Faversham , with traffic through the Saxon Shore ports of Reculver , Richborough , Dover and Lympne converging on Canterbury before heading up Watling Street to London . The town was less than 10 miles from Canterbury , and consequently Faversham had become established on this road network by 50 AD following the initial conquest by Claudius in 43 AD . Numerous remains of Roman buildings have been discovered in and around Faversham , including under St Mary of Charity Church where coins and urns were discovered during reconstruction of the western tower in 1794 .

However , other nobles turned to the nobleman John Zápolya , who was being supported by Suleiman . Under Charles V and his brother Ferdinand I , the Habsburgs reoccupied Buda and took possession of Hungary . Reacting in 1529 , Suleiman marched through the valley of the Danube and regained control of Buda ; in the following autumn his forces laid siege to Vienna . This was to be the Ottoman Empire 's most ambitious expedition and the apogee of its drive to the West . With a reinforced garrison of 16 @,@ 000 men , the Austrians inflicted the first defeat on Suleiman , sowing the seeds of a bitter Ottoman @-@ Habsburg rivalry , which lasted until the 20th century . His second attempt to conquer Vienna failed in 1532 , with Ottoman forces delayed by the siege of Güns , failing to reach Vienna .

Though ill , he forced himself to press on with his duties , issuing orders from his sickbed . On December 7 he moved his command post from Shanghai to Suzhou in order to be closer to the frontlines , and on December 9 he ordered that a \" summons to surrender \" be dropped by airplane over Nanking .

The story was published in 1933 , in America in Hearst 's International – Cosmopolitan , and in Britain in Nash 's Pall Mall Magazine . In an article written many years later , Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel : \" The idea [ for the short story ] came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lonely settler [ Christie ] ... and reflecting how easily he could hold me prisoner .

Despite traveling at speeds of over 600 mph ( 970 km / h ) , tsunamis in deep seas have wavelengths from 80 to 300 miles ( 130 to 480 km ) and an amplitude of less than three feet . Standard surface waves in the same region may only have wavelengths of a few hundred feet and speeds up to 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) but , when compared to their possible amplitudes of up to 45 ft ( 14 m ) , tsunamis at this stage are often able to pass unnoticed . Tsunami warning systems rely on the fact that seismic waves caused by earthquakes travel around the world at around 14 @,@ 400 kilometers ( 8 @,@ 900 mi ) per hour , allowing threatened regions to be alerted to the possibility of a tsunami . Measurements from a network of sea @-@ level measuring stations make it possible to confirm or cancel a tsunami warning . A trigger event on the continental shelf may cause a local tsunami on the land side and a distant tsunami that travels out across the ocean . The energy of the wave is dissipated only gradually but is spread out over the wave front . As the wave radiates away from the source , the front gets longer and the average energy reduces , so distant shores will generally be hit by weaker waves . However , as the speed of the wave is controlled by the water depth , it does not travel at the same speed in all directions and this affects the direction of the wave front . This effect , known as refraction , can focus the strength of an advancing tsunami on some areas while weakening it in others , according to the undersea topography along its path ."

    "text": "While touring Europe for a second time , in an attempt to integrate foreign design trends into the new Trubia , Captain Ruiz de Toledo found a new type of track system in Germany . Designed to avoid having problems with the tracks coming off the vehicle , the new design substituted the traditional tracks with a system which was held together by a lateral metal wall , with the roadwheels suspended from the chassis . The track system was the most innovative and unique part of the new Trubia light tank . Apart from the new tracks , the Trubia was to have a greater velocity ( at least 30 kilometers per hour ( 19 mph ) ) and greater road range than the FT . While a new machine gun was installed on the glacis plate , the tank 's crew was increased from two to three , which caused the hull to be enlarged ; this also allowed the engine to be maintained from inside the vehicle , allowing the crew to fix small breakdowns in the field . To refrigerate the engine and the crew , a compressed air dispenser was installed inside the chassis . This solved problems dealing with the crew 's claustrophobia and the intake of gasses originating from the engine found in the FT , and made crewing the tank much more ergonomic . The original 50 horsepower ( 37 kW ) was replaced with a more powerful 75 horsepower ( 56 kW ) Daimler four cylinder engine . The transmission had four forward gears and four reverse gears . The new tank proved satisfactory — and even bettered the FT in some aspects — and the Spanish Army ordered the construction of four prototypes ."

By April 1944 , No. 9 Group had become a garrison force in New Guinea and lost its mobile function to No. 10 ( Operational ) Group ( later the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) . No. 9 Group was therefore re @-@ formed as a dedicated area command covering air units in New Guinea ; Bostock had recommended calling it Northern Area , before RAAF Headquarters settled on Northern Command . In August that year , RAAF Headquarters proposed to disband the training and maintenance groups formed in 1941 – 42 and return their functions to the control of the area commands , but no action was taken . The same month , the Air Board recommended carving a new Central Area Command out of Eastern Area , which it considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters . This proposed Central Area would have been responsible for units in southern Queensland but the War Cabinet deferred its decision , as it had when a similar concept was raised in October 1943 ."

A disturbance along the front began rotating on December 2 , developing into a small but powerful extratropical storm on the next day . By late on December 3 , the storm attained hurricane @-@ force winds , and it increasingly became the dominant system within the broad frontal region .

The winds diminished below hurricane @-@ intensity on December 5 , and concurrently the inner structure became more tropical as the frontal features dissipated .

The user must first store a substantial amount of chakra to form the Byakugo Seal ( 百豪の印 , Byakugō no In , lit . \" Strength of a Hundred Seal \" ) at the forehead . To activate the technique , the user releases the seal to forcibly release the stored chakra to the body . Through the input of the user , proteins hasten the creation of new cells through cell division , which regenerates any injuries sustained by the user . Thus , as long as the user have enough chakra , they are able to regenerate even the most fatal injuries , essentially making them \" invincible \" in combat . However , because body cells can only divide a number of times in life , the user is basically shortening their own lifespan by speeding up the process . Tsunade manages to counteract this to a certain extent through her long lifespan , thus she is able to live even after using the jutsu several times . The jutsu also has a variation , Mitotic Regeneration : One Hundred Healings ( 百豪の術 , Byakugō no Jutsu , lit . \" Strength of a Hundred Technique \" ) . Though it has the same effect as the original , the user does not need to input chakra to activate , thus injuries are automatically regenerated as the damages are done . Tsunade , for the longest time the only ninja who had mastered this technique , had made the rule that prohibits any medical ninja to directly participate in battles if they had not mastered this technique . Tsunade 's student , Sakura Haruno , is also able to use One Hundred Healings after having stored her chakra for three years to form the Byakugo Seal ."

Several days later , Bakri was excluded from returning to Britain by the Home Secretary , Charles Clarke , on the grounds that his presence in Britain was \" not conducive to the public good . \" Choudary condemned the decision and demanded to know what Bakri had done to justify the ban . He claimed that ministers were inventing rules to ensure that Bakri could not return . In November Choudary and three other followers of Bakri were deported from Lebanon , and returned to the UK . Choudary blamed the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for orchestrating their deportations , claiming that the four were there to help Bakri set up a madrasah ."

Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles , which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant , while others have pushed for a sense of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles . Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European , concluding that the music of the United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation . Instead , the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups , all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War , when people from across the country were brought together in army units , trading musical styles and practices . Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War \" the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America : the first ' American ' sounding music , as distinct from any regional style derived from another country . \""

The difficulties of classification involve the difference between national law ( where the subjects of the law include natural persons and corporations ) and international law ( where the subjects include sovereign states and international organizations ) .

Especially in terms of the European tradition , the term federation is equated with a sovereign federal state in international law ; so the EU cannot be called a federation — at least , not without qualification . It is , however , described as being based on a federal model or federal in nature ; and so it may be appropriate to consider it a federal union of states , a conceptual structure lying between the confederation of states and the federal state .

The only cerebellum @-@ like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus ( DCN ) , one of the two primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve . The DCN is a layered structure , with the bottom layer containing granule cells similar to those of the cerebellum , giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally . The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically — they receive parallel fiber input , but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers . The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells . They are glutamatergic , but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects — they have spiny , flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input , but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers , which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers . The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals , and is considerably reduced in primates .

Peter Weston and Mike Crisp of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney reviewed and recognised the Australian members of the genus Oreocallis as distinct from their South American counterparts , and hence reallocated them to the new genus Alloxylon in 1991 . They coined the binomial name of Alloxylon flammeum , the type material having been collected by Garry Sankowsky and Peter Radke from Tolga Scrub in August 1987 . Weston and Crisp designated it the type species of the genus Alloxylon . Aside from tree waratah , it has also been called the satin oak , pink silky oak , satin silky oak , red silky oak , red oak , lowland bull oak , and Queensland waratah .

At the Salisbury parliament of February 1297 , Roger Bigod , Earl of Norfolk , in his capacity as Marshal of England , objected to a royal summons of military service . Bigod argued that the military obligation only extended to service alongside the King ; if the King intended to sail to Flanders , he could not send his subjects to Gascony . In July , Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun , Earl of Hereford and Constable of England , drew up a series of complaints known as the Remonstrances , in which objections to the extortionate level of taxation were voiced . Undeterred , Edward requested another lay subsidy . This one was particularly provocative , because the King had sought consent only from a small group of magnates , rather than from representatives from the communities in parliament . While Edward was in Winchelsea , preparing for the campaign in Flanders , Bigod and Bohun turned up at the Exchequer to prevent the collection of the tax . As the King left the country with a greatly reduced force , the kingdom seemed to be on the verge of civil war . What resolved the situation was the English defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Stirling Bridge . The renewed threat to the homeland gave king and magnates common cause .

    "text": "The Liliaceae family was described by Michel Adanson in 1763 and formally named by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 . Jussieu defined this grouping as having a calyx of six equal colored parts , six stamens , a superior ovary , single style , and a trilocular ( three @-@ chambered ) capsule . By 1845 , John Lindley , the first English systematist unhappily acknowledged the great diversity in the circumscription of the family , and that it had expanded vastly , with many subdivisions . As he saw it , the Liliaceae were already paraphyletic ( \" catch @-@ all \" ) , being all Liliales not included in the other orders , but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better . He recognized 133 genera and 1200 species . By the time of the next major British classification – that of Bentham and Hooker in 1883 ( published in Latin ) – several of Lindley 's other families had already been absorbed into the Liliaceae . Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly , and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary , eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4 @,@ 500 species , within the order Liliales in the Cronquist system ( 1981 ) . Cronquist merged the Liliaceae with the Amaryllidaceae , making this one of the largest monocotyledon families ."

The first two of these are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs , while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry . ( The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically , although this may still be possible in the two previous elements ununtrium and flerovium . ) Thus , the + 1 oxidation state should be favored , like Tl + , and consistent with this the first ionization potential of ununpentium should be around 5 @.@ 58 eV , continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens . Ununpentium and ununtrium both have one electron outside a quasi @-@ closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state : thus they should have similar melting and boiling points ( both melting around 400 ° C and boiling around 1100 ° C ) due to the strength of their metallic bonds being similar . Additionally , the predicted ionization potential , ionic radius ( 1 @.@ 5 Å for Uup + ; 1 @.@ 0 Å for Uup3 + ) , and polarizability of Uup + are expected to be more similar to Tl + than its true congener Bi3 + .

Nolan drew inspiration from Bane 's comic book debut in the 1993 \" Knightfall \" storyline , the 1986 series The Dark Knight Returns , and the 1999 storyline \" No Man 's Land \" . Filming took place in locations including Jodhpur , London , Nottingham , Glasgow , Los Angeles , New York City , Newark , and Pittsburgh . Nolan used IMAX 70 mm film cameras for much of the filming , including the first six minutes of the film , to optimize the quality of the picture . A vehicle variation of the Batplane and Batcopter termed the \" Bat \" , an underground prison set , and a new Batcave set were created specifically for the film . As with The Dark Knight , viral marketing campaigns began early during production . When filming concluded , Warner Bros. refocused its campaign : developing promotional websites , releasing the first six minutes of the film , screening theatrical trailers , and sending out information regarding the film 's plot ."

The extinct genera Noronhomys and Carletonomys , described in 1999 and 2008 respectively , were also recognized as members of the group . In 2006 , a broad morphological and molecular phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between Holochilus , Lundomys , and Pseudoryzomys . Within this group , morphological data supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Lundomys to the exclusion of Pseudoryzomys , but DNA sequence data favored a clustering between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys to the exclusion of Lundomys ; among all oryzomyines , this was the only case where relationships which received strong support from morphological and DNA sequence data conflicted . Together , the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ( \" clade D \" ) , which contains tens of other species . Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water , being partially aquatic , as do Pseudoryzomys and its relatives . Morphological data indicate that the genus Oryzomys is the closest relative of the group that includes Pseudoryzomys , but DNA sequence data from the nuclear IRBP gene did not support this relationship ; convergent adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the morphological support for a relation between Oryzomys and the other three genera ."

It was not , however , the only Arthurian influence on the developing \" Matter of Britain \" . There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey 's work became widely known ( see for example , the Modena Archivolt ) , and \" Celtic \" names and stories not found in Geoffrey 's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances . From the perspective of Arthur , perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was on the role of the king himself : much of this 12th @-@ century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere , Percival , Galahad , Gawain , and Tristan and Iseult . Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre @-@ Galfridian material and Geoffrey 's Historia itself , in the romances he is rapidly sidelined . His character also alters significantly . In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior , who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns , whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainéant , the \" do @-@ nothing king \" , whose \" inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society \" . Arthur 's role in these works is frequently that of a wise , dignified , even @-@ tempered , somewhat bland , and occasionally feeble monarch . So , he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot 's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu , whilst in Chrétien de Troyes 's Yvain , the Knight of the Lion , he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap . Nonetheless , as Norris J. Lacy has observed , whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances , \" his prestige is never — or almost never — compromised by his personal weaknesses ... his authority and glory remain intact . \""

The song uses a rainstorm as a metaphor for troubles in life , while encouraging others to \" make it through the rain \" through perseverance . The fist chorus begins : \" When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved \" , illustrating a moment in an individual 's life where they are surrounded by conflict . The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering , \" I can make it through the rain , I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I 'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain \" . Similarly , the second verse once again revisits difficult times when \" shadows grow close \" , before continuing into the second chorus and climax . While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength , it also allows them into Carey 's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001 . Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a \" triumph over adversity \" , while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote \" it 's an insight into her recent troubles . \" In an interview with MTV News , Carey described the song 's lyrical content in depth :"

His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay . Unlike the positively charged alpha particles , which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms , neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier , and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium . This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons , work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938 ."

Alvarez wrote an essay entitled \" An American Childhood in the Dominican Republic \" , in which she reveals some information about her own life . This is evidence that it may have served as the basis for the novel . For example , she mentions that it was Mr. Victor , of the US embassy and a member of the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , who persuaded Carlos García to join the resistance against Trujillo , and later helped him in leaving the country , and obtaining a job with an international cardiovascular team . This is a parallel to the novel in which Carlos Garcia obtains work as a doctor in New York . Julia Alvarez emigrated to the United States at the age of 10 with her parents and three sisters as political refugees from the Dominican Republic . The novel is a variation of her real @-@ life experiences , which have perhaps been slightly altered . The majority of her literature is constructed from multiple viewpoints and a strongly concealed political undercurrent is present in her literature . In this case , that undercurrent is her family fleeing the Trujillo revolution , something she did as a child . The novel encompasses the impact living under a regime can have on a family , and the way it shaped the four girls ' upbringing . It is also an attempt to understand memory , the past , and a time before the sisters lost their innocence and accents ."

This camp was extremely well guarded and in consequence it was decided that the only possible method of escape would be by way of a tunnel . On the 18th September , 1942 , tunnelling began . All officers and other ranks worked , with the exception of one officer who was awaiting repatriation . The entrance to the tunnel was through a sealed up chapel which all soil was placed . The work , which consisted of a 3 foot by 3 foot tunnel , 40 feet long with a 10 foot shaft at the entrance and a 7 foot shaft at the exit , was completed by the end of February 1943 . At 2100 hours on the 29th March , 1943 , Brigadiers Miles and Hargest , in company with four other officers , escaped through the tunnel . The four other officers were subsequently recaptured . Brigadiers Miles and Hargest dressed as workmen and having walked to Florence station , caught a train to Milan where they went to the North station . They caught a train to Como and walked towards Chiasso . 2 kilometres from Chiasso they left the main road and proceeded across country until they reached a knoll south of Chiasso where the frontier lay along the opposite slope of a valley below them . The frontier consisted of heavy cyclone netting 12 foot high interlaced with brambles and with small bells near the top . They cut the wire with pliers at ground level without making much noise and came on to Swiss territory at 220 hours on the 30th March , 1943 . They gave themselves up to the police at Mendrisio and were released in Berne on the 2nd April , 1943 ."

These oppositions establish tension before the poem asks as to how they can be reconciled . These images and their being reconciled are described as analogous to the effects of an Aeolian harp and Coleridge 's pantheistic feelings towards nature . In terms of religion , The Eolian Harp describes the mind 's desire to seek after the divine . His approach is similar to Ralph Cudworth 's in The True Intellectual System of the Universe . However , Coleridge 's pantheistic feelings on nature are said to receive reproof from Fricker , and Coleridge returns to a more traditional view of God that deals more with faith than finding the divine within nature ."

But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman , and the grounds for their account are not very clear . They consider fish to be sacred , and they never eat them ; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove , for they believe it is holy . And these things are done , they believe , because of Derketo and Semiramis , the first because Derketo has the shape of a fish , and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove . Well , I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps ; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way .

DVT formation typically begins inside the valves of the calf veins , where the blood is relatively oxygen deprived , which activates certain biochemical pathways . Several medical conditions increase the risk for DVT , including cancer , trauma , and antiphospholipid syndrome . Other risk factors include older age , surgery , immobilization ( as with bed rest , orthopedic casts , and sitting on long flights ) , combined oral contraceptives , pregnancy , the postnatal period , and genetic factors . Those genetic factors include deficiencies with antithrombin , protein C , and protein S , the mutation of Factor V Leiden , and the property of having a non @-@ O blood type .

Clement then criticizes the simplistic anthropomorphism of most ancient religions , quoting Xenophanes ' famous description of African , Thracian and Egyptian deities . The Greek gods may also have had their origins in the personification of material objects : Ares representing iron , and Dionysus wine . Prayer , and the relationship between love and knowledge are then discussed . 1 Corinthians 13 : 8 seems to contradict the characterization of the true Christian as one who knows ; but to Clement knowledge vanishes only in that it is subsumed by the universal love expressed by the Christian in his reverence for his Creator . Following Socrates , he argues that vice arises from a state of ignorance , not from intention . The Christian is a \" labourer in God 's vineyard \" , responsible both for his own path to salvation and that of his neighbor . The work ends with an extended passage against the contemporary divisions and heresies within the church ."

He felt that the solid plot and the unambiguous storytelling of The Immortals of Meluha was missing in The Secret of the Nagas , whose ending failed to live up the curiosity . Pal particularly criticized Tripathi 's language , saying \" It seems that while writing The Secret of the Nagas , much of Amish ’ s attention was upon language . There are obvious and woefully inept attempts at literary flair that make the novel a tiresome read . The book suffers from a rash of exclamation marks and unnecessary italics . Sentences have been sliced to create weak , dangling fragments ( ' Parashuram charged . Followed by his vicious horde ' ) . Instead of simply talking , people bellow , scream , whisper and fall silent . They are flabbergasted , they pirouette in the middle of a fight , and use words like ' exponentially ' , ' gargantuan ' and ' plethora ' in their speech . The net result is text that is labored , trite and awkward . \" Kishwar Desai from Asian Age felt that in The Secret of the Nagas , the characterization of Shiva lost some of the fervor in it from the first book , and is cast more as a Bollywood hero , comparable to the likes of actor Salman Khan . Desai also noticed that there were too many characters in the book , most of them remaining unexplored . Likening the book with a computer game , the reviewer concluded that \" one of the remarkable qualities of [ the book ] is that it is a very visual tale and less like a literary exercise . \" Some critics like Sandipan Deb of Outlook though favored the visual style more and felt that Tripathi stayed true to the fantasy genre ."
