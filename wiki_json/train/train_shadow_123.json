In another work , The Haven @-@ finding Art ( 1599 ) ( see below ) , Wright stated that \" the time of my first employment at sea \" was \" now more than tenne yeares since \" . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography asserts that during the expedition Wright called himself \" Captain Edward Carelesse \" , and that he was also the captain of the Hope in Sir Francis Drake 's voyage of 1585 – 1586 to the West Indies , which evacuated Sir Walter Raleigh 's Colony of Virginia . One of the colonists was the mathematician Thomas Harriot , and if the Dictionary is correct it is probable that on the return journey to England Wright and Harriot became acquainted and discussed navigational mathematics . However , in a 1939 article , E.J.S. Parsons and W.F. Morris note that in Capt. Walter Bigges and Lt. Crofts ' book A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage ( 1589 ) , Edward Careless was referred to as the commander of the Hope , but Wright was not mentioned . Further , while Wright spoke several times of his participation in the Azores expedition , he never alluded to any other voyage . Although the reference to his \" first employment \" in The Haven @-@ finding Art suggests an earlier venture , there is no evidence that he went to the West Indies .

Although Arthur had worked closely with Dorsey before his presidency , once in office he supported the investigation and forced the resignation of officials suspected in the scandal .

This land would not be restored to Parthia until the reign of Sanatruces of Parthia ( r. c . 78 – 71 BC ) . Following the outbreak of the Third Mithridatic War , Mithridates VI of Pontus ( r . 119 – 63 BC ) , an ally of Tigranes II of Armenia , requested aid from Parthia against Rome , but Sanatruces refused help . When the Roman commander Lucullus marched against the Armenian capital Tigranocerta in 69 BC , Mithridates VI and Tigranes II requested the aid of Phraates III of Parthia ( r. c . 71 – 58 ) . Phraates did not send aid either , and after the fall of Tigranocerta he reaffirmed with Lucullus the Euphrates as the boundary between Parthia and Rome ."

This faction approached Æthelflæd , Lady of the Mercians , an Anglo @-@ Saxon and a Christian , with an offer of submission , but negotiations were ended by her premature death in June 918 ."

The Middletons had a new house built on Highland Road near the campus , and an oil field was discovered under their property , bringing them royalties that would pay for their property many times over . University enrollment began to climb in 1938 and the LSU football team had just finished three outstanding seasons under coach Bernie Moore , winning 27 of their 30 regular season games . Middleton was photographed breaking ground for a new faculty club that year , as the campus grew in many areas . All seemed to be running well when in June 1939 the campus was given a shock from which it would take many years to recover . A New Orleans newspaper ran a photo on the front page showing an LSU truck unloading building materials in suburban New Orleans , revealing an illegal operation . The ensuing investigation led to the discovery that LSU 's President Smith had embezzled nearly a million dollars from the university , using the money to cover his losses while speculating in the Chicago wheat futures market . Smith stood trial , and was sent to the penitentiary in Angola . The LSU superintendent of grounds and buildings , George Caldwell , was also involved in the scandal and served time in Atlanta for tax evasion . Meanwhile , the state 's governor , Richard Leche , resigned , but was soon found guilty of several federal charges and sent to Atlanta to serve time ."

In the latter case , Rio de Janeiro 's tourist board – who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime , kidnappings , slums , and monkey and rat infestations – went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action . Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode \" A Star Is Burns \" ( season six , 1995 ) which featured a crossover with The Critic . He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic , and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him . When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled , he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns , openly criticizing James L.

The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer , who provides the voice of Skinner . In a 2001 interview , Shearer recalled that after reading the script , he told the writers , \" That 's so wrong .

Nursehounds may occupy refuges to hide from predators , avoid harassment by mature conspecifics , and / or to facilitate thermoregulation . In captivity , these sharks are gregarious and tend to rest in groups , though the individuals comprising any particular group changes frequently . This species is less common than the small @-@ spotted catshark ."

    "text": "A film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has unusual significance . For example , Norman Wisdom 's films , friendly to Marxist interpretation , amassed a cult following in Albania , as they were among the few Western films allowed by the country 's Communist rulers . The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) and its star , Judy Garland , hold special significance to American and British gay culture , although it is a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture . Similarly , James Dean and his brief film career have become icons of alienated youth . Cult films can have such niche appeal that they are only popular within certain subcultures , such as Reefer Madness ( 1936 ) and Hemp for Victory ( 1942 ) among stoner subculture . Beach party musicals , popular among American surfers , failed to find an equivalent audience when imported to the United Kingdom . When films target subcultures like this , they may seem unintelligible without the proper cultural capital . Films which appeal to teenagers may offer subcultural identities that are easily recognized and differentiate various subcultural groups . Films which appeal to stereotypical male activities , such as sports , can easily gain strong male cult followings . Sports metaphors are often used in the marketing of cult films to males , such as emphasizing the \" extreme \" nature of the film , which increases the appeal to youth subcultures fond of extreme sports ."

As a result , each episode was structured like a magazine , which made it possible for the producers to create a mixture of styles , paces , and characters .

As Lesser stated , \" It is unlikely that any other approach would have provided enough room to present material on the wide range of goals we had selected \" . Producers found that if the show 's segments were sufficiently varied in character , content , style , pace , and mood , children 's attention was able to be sustained throughout each episode .

In the periodic table , it is located to the right of the actinide uranium , to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium . Neptunium is a hard metal , having a bulk modulus of 118 GPa , comparable to that of manganese . Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability . When exposed to air at normal temperatures , it forms a thin oxide layer . This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases . Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639 ± 3 ° C : this low melting point , a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium ( which has melting point 639 @.@ 4 ° C ) , is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal .

The Free Press Clause protects the right of individuals to express themselves through publication and dissemination of information , ideas and opinions without interference , constraint or prosecution by the government . This right was described in Branzburg v. Hayes as \" a fundamental personal right \" that is not confined to newspapers and periodicals . In Lovell v. City of Griffin ( 1938 ) , Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes defined \" press \" as \" every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion \" . This right has been extended to media including newspapers , books , plays , movies , and video games . While it is an open question whether people who blog or use social media are journalists entitled to protection by media shield laws , they are protected equally by the Free Speech Clause and the Free Press Clause , because both clauses do not distinguish between media businesses and nonprofessional speakers . This is further shown by the Supreme Court consistently refusing to recognize the First Amendment as providing greater protection to the institutional media than to other speakers .

Renown began the action by attacking Gneisenau with her 15 @-@ inch guns . The German warships returned fire at 05 : 08 with Gneisenau scoring two hits on Renown with her 11 inch shells . Both shells failed to explode , with the first hitting the British battlecruiser ′ s foremast and the second passing through the ship near the steering gear room . About the same time , Renown struck Gneisenau with two shells . These hits damaged the German battleship 's director tower , forward range finders , and aft turret . Renown then moved her fire to Scharnhorst . These early salvos were sporadic and lasted until 06 : 00 , when the engagement was broken off for 20 minutes due to waves breaking over Renown ′ s forward turrets ."

Despite his opposition to the king 's colonial policy , Cornwallis had retained King George III 's favour , and was rapidly promoted . On September 29 , 1775 he was promoted to major general . In November he offered to serve in North America on a proposed expedition to the southern colonies , even though the number of officers that were senior to him in rank meant he was unlikely to get an independent command . This generosity was appreciated by the king and by Lord George Germain , the secretary of state for the colonies . On January 1 , 1776 he was given the rank of lieutenant general in North America . His orders from Lord Germain were to accompany a convoy of troops from Cork , Ireland to North America , where he was to join at Cape Fear , North Carolina with General Henry Clinton , who was bringing troops from Boston for operations in the southern colonies . Clinton arrived at Cape Fear well before the earl , since logistics delayed the convoy 's departure , and then bad weather slowed its progress across the Atlantic . Cornwallis expected to have good relations with Clinton ; a mutual friend , William Phillips , reported Cornwallis to be \" very happy to think he shall serve under an old friend and a man he has so good an opinion of . \""

As well as this , the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head , so their vision consists of two fields , rather than a binocular view like humans have . When belugas surface , their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light ; they contain both rod and cone cells , meaning they can see in both dim and bright light , but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells . Whales do , however , lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals . Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs , enlarged pupils ( which shrink as they surface to prevent damage ) , slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum ; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and , therefore , a very clear image of the surrounding area .

Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches ( a type of convergent boundary , also known as a destructive plate boundary ) by a process known as subduction . Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet , and the denser ( older ) slab begins to descend back into the mantle . At the consumption edge of the plate ( the oceanic trench ) , the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense , and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction . The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere , so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old .

These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa 's earlier novel The Green House , but in a different form . As such , Captain Pantoja and the Special Service is essentially a parody of both The Green House and the literary approach that novel represents . Vargas Llosa 's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle ."

In the Time of the Butterflies ( 1994 ) , by Julia Álvarez , tells the story of the Mirabal sisters , whom patriotism transformed from well @-@ behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty @-@ year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic . The novel sought to illuminate the officially @-@ obscured @-@ history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters , not to determine what happened to them , but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic .

Other sources of fermentable carbohydrates were also explored such as manioc and other feedstocks . The first phase of the program concentrated in production of anhydrous ethanol for blending with gasoline ."

    "text": "Modern historians have also re @-@ examined the role of the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the accession process . Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed , and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950 . He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession , and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes . Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion . Copland disagrees , on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign , and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements . He also criticises Mountbatten 's role , saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law , he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place , and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence . Both Copland and Ramusack argue that , in the ultimate analysis , one of the reasons why the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British , and saw themselves as having little other option . Older historians such as Lumby , in contrast , take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power , and that their demise was inevitable . They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten , and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes , who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted , unsuccessfully , to do for over a century — unite all of India under one rule ."

The lungs normally \" filter out \" bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream ; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain , where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke . HHT is the most common cause of lung AVMs : out of all people found to have lung AVMs , 70 – 80 % are due to HHT .

In a career spanning 30 years , Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting is not a true calling , rather it is just a job he fell into ."

The 1972 NBA Finals MVP is holder of numerous official NBA all @-@ time records , establishing himself as a scoring champion , all @-@ time top rebounder and accurate field goal shooter . He led the NBA in scoring seven times , field goal percentage nine times , minutes played eight times , rebounding eleven times , and assists once . He was also responsible for several rule changes , including widening the lane from 12 to 16 feet , as well as changes to rules regarding inbounding the ball and shooting free throws . Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100 @-@ point game , which is widely considered one of basketball 's greatest records . Decades after his record , many NBA teams did not even average 100 points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted . The closest any player has gotten to 100 points was the Los Angeles Lakers ' Kobe Bryant , who scored 81 in 2006 . Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain 's record was \" unthinkable ... It 's pretty exhausting to think about it . \" Chamberlain 's main weakness was his notoriously poor free throw shooting , where he has the third lowest career free throw percentage in NBA history with 51 @.@ 1 % ( based on a minimum of 1 @,@ 200 attempts ) . Chamberlain claimed that he intentionally missed free throws so a teammate could get the rebound and score two points instead of one , but later acknowledged that he was a \" psycho case \" in this matter . On the other hand , he committed surprisingly few fouls during his NBA career , despite the rugged play in the post . Chamberlain never fouled out of a regular season or playoff game in his 14 @-@ year NBA career .

It is a very quick , extremely agile , alert , and nervous snake . When confronted it will quickly attempt to escape ( usually up a tree if possible ) and avoid any sort of confrontation . If cornered , the western green mamba is highly dangerous and will show a fearsome display of aggression , loudly hissing and striking repeatedly ."

This hypothesis has been seriously questioned , since its closest relatives , such as Kentrosaurus , had more low surface area spikes than plates , implying that cooling was not important enough to require specialized structural formations such as plates . Another possible function is that the plates may have helped the animal increase heat absorption from the sun . Since a cooling trend occurred towards the end of the Jurassic , a large ectothermic reptile might have used the increased surface area afforded by the plates to absorb radiation from the sun ."

This has led to an argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe . This argument is evident at Montacute , where Gothic pinnacles , albeit obelisk in form , are combined with Renaissance gables , pediments , classical statuary , ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass . This profusion of large , mullioned windows , an innovation of their day , give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass ; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire . However , despite the Dutch gables , a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England , and the Gothic elements , much of the architectural influence is Italian ."

Commencing on 22 January 1947 , one of No. 38 Squadron 's main responsibilities was to conduct thrice @-@ weekly courier flights to Japan to support the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . These flights were the longest regular air route serviced by twin @-@ engined aircraft at the time , and took several days to complete . The courier flights continued until 13 January 1948 , after which chartered Qantas aircraft were used to support the force in Japan . In August 1948 , five of No. 38 Squadron 's air crews were dispatched to Europe where , as members of the RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift , they participated in the international efforts to fly supplies into Berlin during the Soviet blockade of the city . These personnel remained in Europe for 12 months , and their absence greatly disrupted No. 38 Squadron 's operations . Overall , twenty members of No. 86 Wing were sent to Europe ; the resulting shortage of personnel forced Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons to operate for a period as a single unit , all flying hours being attributed to No. 38 Squadron in official records . No. 86 Wing moved to Richmond between 22 June and 1 July 1949 ."

Key figures that were influenced by the Hunters ' work and by Romanticism include John Brown ( 1735 – 88 ) , Thomas Beddoes ( 1760 – 1808 ) and John Barclay ( 1758 – 1826 ) . Brown argued in Elementa Medicinae ( 1780 ) that life is an essential \" vital energy \" or \" excitability \" and that disease is either the excessive or diminished redistribution of the normal intensity of the human organ , which became known as Brunonianism . This work was highly influential , particularly in Germany , on the development of Naturphilosophie . This work was translated and edited by Beddoes , another graduate of Edinburgh , whose own work , Hygeia , or Essays Moral and Medical ( 1807 ) expanded on these ideas . Following in this vein , Barclay in the 1810 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica identified physiology as the branch of medicine closest to metaphysics . Also important were the brothers John ( 1763 – 1820 ) and Charles Bell ( 1774 – 1842 ) , who made significant advances in the study of the vascular and nervous systems , respectively ."

Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby so that in case of a bite , they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go . The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat dander , hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction , not toxicosis . Loris bites cause a painful swelling , and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock . However , although the toxin is only produced when the brachial secretion and saliva are mixed , both the secretion and saliva may have unique chemical properties and may act separately . Furthermore , secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food , augmenting the toxicity .

Later that year , the Kingdom of Serbia and the State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs formed the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes — subsequently renamed Yugoslavia . The proponents of the new union in the Croatian parliament saw the move as a safeguard against Italian expansionism as stipulated in the Treaty of London . The treaty was largely disregarded by Britain and France because of conflicting promises made to Serbia and a perceived lack of Italian contribution to the war effort outside Italy itself . The 1919 Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye did transfer the Austrian Littoral and Istria to Italy , but awarded Dalmatia to Yugoslavia . Following the war , a private force of demobilized Italian soldiers seized Rijeka and set up the Italian Regency of Carnaro — seen as a harbinger of Fascism — in order to force the recognition of Italian claims to the city . After sixteen months of the Regency 's existence , the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo redefined the Italian – Yugoslav borders , among other things transferring Zadar and the islands of Cres , Lastovo and Palagruža to Italy , securing the island of Krk for Yugoslavia and establishing the Free State of Fiume ; this new state was abolished in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome that awarded Fiume ( modern Rijeka ) to Italy and Sušak to Yugoslavia ."

Some useful models are abstract , focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain ; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons . No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function , though . The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively — current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time ."

On other parts of the body , the long and stiff guard hairs , which shed moisture , are usually colored in shades of gray and , to a lesser extent , brown .

The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language : particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous \" To be , or not to be \" soliloquy : \" To be , or not to be , aye there 's the point . / To die , to sleep , is that all ?

J.R. had swindled most of the other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization . Cartel member , Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide as a result of the dealings . Soon thereafter , Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization . The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone , whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil . Marilee 's calls to J.R. are refused . Cartel member Vaughn Leland , who lost $ 20 million ( US $ 57 million in 2016 dollars ) in the deal , reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him , but Jock refuses to offer any restitution . All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings . The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information . J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him . Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor / boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason . Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone . Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information . Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between the sheets and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells . Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R. ' s secretary . Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother , Rebecca . They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger . Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re @-@ institutionalize her . Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action . J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard 's request for records and to shred them . Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist , Dr. Elby . She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop . J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief . He tries to bribe her to leave , but she does not accept the offer . J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen . She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her . He is not worried . She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful . When he leaves for another woman she gets upset , but finds a gun lying around , which gives her pause ."

Having the reward present during work ( and easily accessible ) creates a negative frustration — akin to teasing — rather than providing motivation . For example , a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his / her homework will be less motivated to wait for his / her turn for recess . Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it , then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a motivation to finish it ."

This meter is always used for spell casting , as well as when using the \" Charge Attack \" skill used by the \" Monk \" class . Although players can choose to act immediately , an ability will become more powerful the longer that the player charges the attack . However , the greater the amount of time one charges attacks , the longer the charging character must wait before the next turn . As a result of this , players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts , or can instead aim for the \" sweet spot \" , a special red area on the charging bar , indicating a charge that allows for less time until the next attack , as well as a smaller mana cost . Overall , deciding on the correct amount of charge and letting go of the button at precisely that time can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character 's attacks during combat ."

The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two @-@ ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn . Now , with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia , a canal seemed more essential than ever , and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty . Hay and the British ambassador , Julian Pauncefote , agreed that the United States could control a future canal , provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified . McKinley was satisfied with the terms , but the Senate rejected them , demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal . Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation , but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate 's demands . He was successful , and a new treaty was drafted and approved , but not before McKinley 's assassination in 1901 ."

It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment . Owing to the reform movement , Stigand probably knew the request would be unsuccessful . In 1058 Antipope Benedict X , who opposed much of the reform movement , gave Stigand a pallium . However , Benedict was deposed in the following year ; the reforming party declared Benedict an antipope , and nullified all his acts , including Stigand 's pallium grant .

Neither could God hold any virtues , as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands – if he cannot logically command himself , then he cannot logically have any virtues . Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good , but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy .

Boras had claimed that Alvarez signed his contract after the August 15 deadline had passed , thus won 't report to the Pirates . The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance stating that Hosmer 's contract was also signed past the deadline and that Major League Baseball extended the August 15 deadline without the association 's permission . Both sides settled the claim a month later , allowing Hosmer and Alvarez to join their respective teams . Hosmer never disputed his original contract . Instead of heading back to the Chukars , Hosmer was sent to the Arizona Fall League to train ."

He turned to law , also picking up a good knowledge of the Bible , and was admitted to Gray 's Inn in 1524 . He became Wolsey 's \" man of all work \" . Cromwell , driven in part by his religious beliefs , attempted to reform the body politic of the English government through discussion and consent , and through the vehicle of continuity and not outward change . He was seen by many people as the man they wanted to bring about their shared aims , including Thomas Audley . By 1531 , Cromwell and those associated with him were already responsible for the drafting of much legislation . Cromwell 's first office was that of the master of the King 's jewels in 1532 , from which he began to invigorate the government finances . By this point , Cromwell 's power as an efficient administrator in a Council full of politicians exceeded what Wolsey had achieved . Cromwell did much work through his many offices to remove the tasks of government from the Royal Household ( and ideologically from the personal body of the King ) and into a public state . He did so , however , in a haphazard fashion that left several remnants , not least because he needed to retain Henry 's support , his own power , and the possibility of actually achieving the plan he set out . Cromwell made the various income streams put in place by Henry VII more formal and assigned largely autonomous bodies for their administration . The role of the King 's Council was transferred to a reformed Privy Council , much smaller and more efficient than its predecessor . A difference emerged between the financial health of the king , and that of the country , although Cromwell 's fall undermined much of his bureaucracy , which required his hand to keep order among the many new bodies and prevent profligate spending which strained relations as well as finances . Cromwell 's reforms ground to a halt in 1539 , the initiative lost , and he failed to secure the passage of an enabling act , the Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539 . He too was executed , on 28 July 1540 ."

In this later style , which is influenced by 19th century French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud , the poetry is more allusive , filled with \" chains of flashing images . \" In this song , rather than support a specific cause as in his earlier protest songs , he finds solidarity with all people who are downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly , including unwed mothers , the disabled , refugees , outcasts , those unfairly jailed , \" the luckless , the abandoned and forsaked , \" and , in the final verse , \" the countless confused , accused , misused , strung out ones and worse \" and \" every hung @-@ up person in the whole wide universe . \" By having the chimes of freedom toll for both rebels and rakes , the song is more inclusive in its sympathies than previous protest songs , such as \" The Times They Are A @-@ Changin ' \" , written just the prior year . After \" Chimes of Freedom \" , Dylan 's protest songs no longer depicted social reality in the black and white terms he renounces in \" My Back Pages \" but rather use satirical surrealism to make their points ."

One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of batter around the food , such as cornmeal , flour , or tempura ; breadcrumbs may also be used . After the food is submerged in oil , the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes Maillard reactions which break down sugars and proteins , creating the golden brown exterior of the food . Once the surface is dehydrated , it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption . The heat conducts throughout the food causing proteins to denature , starches to undergo starch gelatinization , and dietary fiber to soften ."

It is an anatomical variant that , when present , supplies blood to the thyroid gland , which is primarily supplied by the inferior and superior thyroid arteries . The artery also supplies the trachea , the parathyroid gland and the thymus gland ( as thymica accessoria ) in rare cases . It has also been reported to be a compensatory artery when one or both of the inferior thyroid arteries are absent and in a few cases the only source of blood to the thyroid gland . Though it mostly arises from the brachiocephalic trunk , it may also originate from other sources . It also varies in size , blood supply , and termination . The artery occurs in only 3 – 10 % of the population and because of the variations , it may cause surgical complications such as severe bleeding ."

The entire court attended , while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery . As soon as George Mouzalon , his brothers and his retinue arrived , the service began . Outside the church , however , soldiers had assembled , many of them Latin mercenaries , and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor . John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them ; the soldiers , however , allegedly mistook this as a signal . Joined by a large mob , they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers . They were warned of what was going on , but George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate . He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd . The mob , however , realized its error ( the secretary was wearing black shoes , while the protovestiarios wore green ones ) and entered the church , the soldiers with swords in hand ."

A better solution is to tag files with attributes that describe them . Attributes are metadata about the files such as the type of file ( such as document , picture , music , creator , etc . ) . This allows files to be searched for by their attributes , in ways not possible using a folder hierarchy , such as finding \" pictures which have person X \" . The attributes can be recognizable by either the file system natively , or via some extension . Desktop search applications take this concept a step further . They extract data , including attributes , from files and index it . To extract the data , they use a filter for each file format .

When Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield , Huggins told him he should continue as a pitcher . Bob Shawkey , a former pitcher who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930 , had convinced Ed Barrow , the Yankees ' general manager , to acquire Ruffing . Shawkey believed he could change Ruffing 's approach to pitching to obtain better results . Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery , so that Ruffing used his body more . This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later innings of the game . The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned as one of the most lopsided trades in baseball history ; Durst was a reserve outfielder who always batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used . The 1930 season proved to be Durst 's last year in the majors . Ruffing had a 0 – 3 record with the Red Sox before the trade .

The distinct segments of the story — Osiris 's death and restoration , Horus 's childhood , and Horus 's conflict with Set — may originally have been independent mythic episodes . If so , they must have begun to coalesce into a single story by the time of the Pyramid Texts , which loosely connect those segments . In any case , the myth was inspired by a variety of influences . Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society : the divine nature of kingship , the succession from one king to another , the struggle to maintain maat , and the effort to overcome death .

However , the quarter @-@ century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy , even approval . In the works of writers such as George Gissing , H.

The first reported European sighting of Lord Howe Island was on 17 February 1788 by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball , commander of the Armed Tender HMS Supply ( the oldest and smallest of the First Fleet ships ) , which was on its way from Botany Bay with a cargo of nine male and six female convicts to found a penal settlement on Norfolk Island . On the return journey of 13 March 1788 Ball observed Ball 's Pyramid and sent a party ashore on Lord Howe Island to claim it as a British possession . Numerous turtles and tame birds were captured and returned to Sydney . Ball named Mount Lidgbird and Balls Pyramid after himself and the main island after Richard Howe , First Earl Howe , who was First Lord of the Admiralty at the time ."

The Vistulans of western Lesser Poland , mentioned in several contemporary written sources , already a large tribal union in the first half of the 9th century , were evolving in the second half of that century toward a super @-@ tribal state , until their efforts were terminated by the more powerful neighbors from the south . Kraków , the main town of the Vistulans , with its Wawel gord , was located along a major \" international \" trade route . The main Vistulan @-@ related archeological find ( in addition to the 8th @-@ century Krakus , Wanda and other large burial mounds and the remnants of several gords ) is the late 9th @-@ century treasure of iron @-@ ax shaped grzywnas , well known as currency units in Great Moravia . They were discovered in 1979 in a wooden chest , below the basement of a medieval house on Kanonicza Street , near the Vistula and the Wawel Hill . The total weight of the iron material is 3630 kilograms and the individual bars of various sizes ( 4212 of them ) were bound in bundles , which suggests that the package was being readied for transportation ."

It was the main ceremonial entrance into the capital , used especially for the occasions of a triumphal entry of an emperor into the capital on the occasion of military victories or other state occasions such as coronations . On rare occasions , as a mark of honor , the entry through the gate was allowed to non @-@ imperial visitors : papal legates ( in 519 and 868 ) and , in 710 , to Pope Constantine . The Gate was used for triumphal entries until the Komnenian period ; thereafter , the only such occasion was the entry of Michael VIII Palaiologos into the city on 15 August 1261 , after its reconquest from the Latins . With the progressive decline in Byzantium 's military fortunes , the gates were walled up and reduced in size in the later Palaiologan period , and the complex converted into a citadel and refuge . The Golden Gate was emulated elsewhere , with several cities naming their principal entrance thus , for instance Thessaloniki ( also known as the Vardar Gate ) or Antioch ( the Gate of Daphne ) , as well as the Kievan Rus ' , who built monumental \" Golden Gates \" at Kiev and Vladimir . The entrance to San Francisco Bay in California was similarly named the Golden Gate in the middle of the nineteenth century , in a distant historical tribute to Byzantium ."

Freed from those obligations , in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare , where he worked with his colleagues Edgar Jaffé and Werner Sombart . His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences ; his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars . In 1904 , Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal , notably his essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , which became his most famous work and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems . This essay was the only one of his works from that period that was published as a book during his lifetime . Some other of his works written in the first one and a half decades of the 20th century – published posthumously and dedicated primarily from the fields of sociology of religion , economic and legal sociology – are also recognised as among his most important intellectual contributions ."

They successfully extracted additional rights , although there was some Protestant resistance to the idea of full Catholic suffrage due to their overwhelming numerical majority . The more radical elements favouring Irish independence found a leader in Theobald Wolfe Tone , who went to France for support from the revolutionaries there that led to an aborted attempt to invade Ireland in 1796 . The failed invasion led the government of the Earl of Camden to round up leaders of the United Irishmen and attempt to disarm the Catholic populace . Use of these tactics was made possible in part by the passage of an Insurrection Act , giving the administration broad police powers , and also by the suspension of habeas corpus in October 1796 ."

    "text": "The thermal wind relation does not explain why the winds are organized into tight jets , rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere . One factor that contributes to the creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub @-@ tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front . This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude . At high altitudes , lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole . This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered ' quasi @-@ geostrophic ' . The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes , as the acceleration / deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low / high pressure respectively , which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region ."

Hoyte had an interest in both history and mountain climbing , and spent the summer of 1956 with friends hiking the Alps and comparing possible routes to the ancient descriptions . The group came to the conclusion that the Col de Clapier was the most likely pass , an opinion still supported by some modern historians ."

However , the court was not moved by this , deciding that Nagashima 's cartridges showed what one could do with knowledge of the TMSS , which Accolade did not possess . According to the court , because knowledge of how to avoid displaying the trademark on the Genesis III was not information that was public to the industry , Sega 's attempt to prove that the display of their trademark was not required for games to be played on the console was insufficient .

This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese ; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese , as that was Maya 's heritage , while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed . Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version , the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization , as changing it would have altered the entire game structure . As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters , it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings : character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds , or were visual gags . A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind ; for the game 's third episode , several Japanese names were used without changes , since they were English puns to begin with . For some other characters , the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals . Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode , the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names , while still making use of deeper meanings . Takumi personally approved all the English names ; for one of the names , Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days , as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one ."

Crane 's work , however , cannot be determined by style solely on chronology . Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters , but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction . Crane 's writing , both fiction and nonfiction , is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated , vivid and intense . The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose , suggestibility , shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences .

In his 1957 work , Pettet did praise the poem as he declared , \" The Ode to a Nightingale has a special interest in that most of us would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats ’ s poems . Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent : there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [ … ] and there is its exceptional degree of ' distillation ' , of concentrated recollection \" . David Perkins felt the need to defend the use of the word \" forlorn \" and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination . When praising the poem in 1959 , Perkins claimed , \" Although the \" Ode to a Nightingale \" ranges more widely than the \" Ode on a Grecian Urn , \" the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol , and , compared with the urn as a symbol , the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages . \" Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word \" forlorn \" by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land . When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry , Bate argued in 1963 , \" Ode to a Nightingale \" is among \" the greatest lyrics in English \" and the only one written with such speed : \" We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly . \" In 1968 , Robert Gittins stated , \" It may not be wrong to regard [ Ode on Indolence and Ode on Melancholy ] as Keats 's earlier essays in this [ ode ] form , and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works . \""

Haas notes that \" control over cotton allows a ruling elite to provide the benefit of cloth for clothing , bags , wraps , and adornment . \" He is willing to admit to a mutual dependency dilemma : \" The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish . \" Thus , identifying cotton as a vital resource produced in the inland does not by itself resolve the issue of whether the inland centers were a progenitor for the coast or vice versa — Moseley argues , for instance , that successful maritime centers would have moved inland to find cotton .

It was the first plant hormone that was proven to be a peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan . Since then other peptides , with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae . Hydroxyproline @-@ rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs ( Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides ) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006 . Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells , upon insect damage , the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides . The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain . The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine @-@ mediated inflammatory immune response in animals . Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant , activating systemic acquired resistance , now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result . The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development . Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores , other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth . They have also been shown to affect plants ' responses to salt stress and UV radiation . AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens . In Nicotiana attenuata , some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology ."

For example , in 1974 , Tattersall and Schwartz labeled Mesopropithecus as a sister group to sifakas . With the discovery of an associated skeleton of M. dolichobrachion near Ankarana in 1986 , it became clear that Mesopropithecus shared distinct traits with sloth lemurs . Unlike the indriids , but like the sloth lemurs , they had elongated forelimbs and other adaptations for arboreal suspension ( hanging in trees ) , linking them most closely to family Paleaeopropithecidae . A comparison of these morphological traits between the sloth lemurs and indriids suggest that Mesopropithecus was the first genus to diverge within the sloth lemur family ."

Moreover , the exceptional education Maximus evidently received could not have been had in any other part of the Byzantine Empire during that time except for Constantinople , and possibly Caesarea and Alexandria .

It is more likely that Maximus was born of an aristocratic family and received an unparalleled education in philosophy , mathematics , astronomy , etc . It is true , however , that Maximus did not study rhetoric as he himself notes in the prologue to his Earlier Ambigua to John , to which his lack of high stylistic by Byzantine standards attests . Nevertheless , for reasons not explained in the few autobiographical details to be gleaned from his texts , Maximus left public life and took monastic vows at the monastery of Philippicus in Chrysopolis , a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople ( later known as Scutari , the modern Turkish city of Üsküdar ) .

After 1962 , he changed the main focus of his career towards examining policies for protecting the quality of the human environment . In 1972 he was the catalyst for founding the School of Public and Environmental Affairs ( SPEA ) at Indiana University , Bloomington . His 1976 article \" Novus Ordo Seclorum : The Heritage of American Public Administration \" in Public Administration Review was a defining paper in the modern history of public administration ."

Joel Coen said : \" Both writers wrote the same kind of plays with proletarian heroes , but their personalities were quite different . Odets was much more of an extrovert ; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood , and this is not the case with Barton Fink ! \" Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York , Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood . Several of his later plays were adapted – by him and others – into movies . One of these , The Big Knife ( 1955 ) , matches Barton 's life much more than Odets ' . In it , an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a movie studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide . Another similarity to Odets ' work is Audrey 's death , which mirrors a scene in Deadline at Dawn ( 1946 ) , a film noir written by Odets . In that film , a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night before has been inexplicably murdered ."

First , increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper , thus encouraging increased use ( the direct rebound effect ) . Second , increased energy efficiency leads to increased economic growth , which pulls up energy use for the whole economy . At the microeconomic level ( looking at an individual market ) , even with the rebound effect , improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption . That is , the rebound effect is usually less than 100 % . However , at the macroeconomic level , more efficient ( and hence comparatively cheaper ) energy leads to faster economic growth , which increases energy use throughout the economy . Saunders argued that , taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects , technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use ."

In reptiles and mammals , it is called the cerebral cortex . Multiple functions involve the pallium , including smell and spatial memory . In mammals , where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain , it takes over functions from many other brain areas . In many mammals , the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci . The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of information that can be stored and processed ."

Upanishadic thought postulated the absolute unchanging reality of Brahman and Ātman and claimed that change was mere illusion . The theory advanced by Buddhists denied the reality of permanence of conditioned phenomena , asserting only interdependence and impermanence . According to the vedāntin ( Upanishadic ) conceptual scheme , the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism , and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme , the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence . The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other 's point of view . The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with anekāntavāda . From the perspective of a higher , inclusive level made possible by the ontology and epistemology of anekāntavāda and syādvāda , Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive ; instead , they are seen as ekantika or only partially true . The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which , according to Jainism , \" recognises substances but not process \" , and Buddhism , which \" recognises process but not substance \" . Jainism , on the other hand , pays equal attention to both substance ( dravya ) and process ( paryaya ) ."

It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel @-@ Joseph Sieyès ( 1748 – 1836 ) in an unpublished manuscript . Sociology was later defined independently by the French philosopher of science , Auguste Comte ( 1798 – 1857 ) , in 1838 . Comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society . Comte had earlier used the term \" social physics \" , but that had subsequently been appropriated by others , most notably the Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet . Comte endeavoured to unify history , psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm . Writing shortly after the malaise of the French Revolution , he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism , an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy ( 1830 – 1842 ) and A General View of Positivism ( 1848 ) . Comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era , after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases , in the progression of human understanding . In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science , and having classified the sciences , Comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term ."

Brant has been described as the \" head of the Six Nations matrons \" , although historian Robert Allen writes that \" there is no substantive evidence to suggest that Molly was ever a clan matron or mother within the Iroquois matrilineal society \" . Fiester and Pulis write that \" although not born to the position , she became one of the Mohawk matrons \" ."

    "text": "During the regal period , the king nominated two Quaestors to serve as his assistants , and after the overthrow of the monarchy , the Consuls retained this authority . However , in 447 BC , Cicero recorded that the Quaestors began to be elected by a tribal assembly that was presided over by a magistrate . It seems as though this was the first instance of a joint Patricio @-@ Plebeian Tribal Assembly , and thus was probably an enormous gain for the Plebeians . While Patricians were able to vote in a joint assembly , there were never very many Patricians in Rome . Thus , most of the electors were Plebeians , and yet any magistrate elected by a joint assembly had jurisdiction over both Plebeians and Patricians . Therefore , for the first time , the Plebeians seemed to have indirectly acquired authority over Patricians . During the 4th century BC , a series of reforms were passed ( the leges Valeriae Horatiae ) , which ultimately required that any law passed by the Plebeian Council have the full force of law over both Plebeians and Patricians . This gave the Plebeian Tribunes , who presided over the Plebeian Council , a positive character for the first time . Before these laws were passed , Tribunes could only interpose the sacrosanctity of their person ( intercessio ) to veto acts of the senate , assemblies , or magistrates . It was a modification to the Valerian law in 449 BC which first allowed acts of the Plebeian Council to have the full force of law , but eventually the final law in the series was passed ( the \" Hortensian Law \" ) , which removed the last check that the Patricians in the senate had over this power ."

In the early 1920s the Victorian state government appointed the War Memorials Advisory Committee , chaired by Sir Baldwin Spencer , which recommended an \" arch of victory \" over St Kilda Road , the major boulevard leading out of the city of Melbourne to the south . In August 1921 an executive committee was formed , with the former commander of the Australian forces in the war , General Sir John Monash , as its driving force . The committee soon abandoned the idea of an arch and proposed a large monumental memorial to the east of St Kilda Road , a position which would make it clearly visible from the centre of the city . A competition was launched in March 1922 to find a design for the new memorial , open both to British subjects residing in Australia and any Australian citizens who were residing overseas . A total of 83 entries were submitted , and in December 1923 the design offered by two Melbourne architects ( and war veterans ) , Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop , was announced as the winner ."

Open @-@ core transformers with a ratio near 1 : 1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps .

Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit , including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil . Efficient , practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s , but within a decade , the transformer would be instrumental in the War of Currents , and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts , a position in which they have remained dominant ever since ."

Suicide is a case study of variations in suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations , and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy . It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism . By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts , he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants , something he attributed to social ( as opposed to individual or psychological ) causes . He developed the notion of objective sui generis \" social facts \" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study . Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is ' healthy ' or ' pathological ' , and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or \" social anomie \" ."

Rawls considered civil disobedience should be viewed as an appeal , warning or admonishment ( showing general respect and fidelity to the rule of law by the non @-@ violence and transparency of methods adopted ) that a law breaches a community 's fundamental virtue of justice . Objections to Rawls ' theory include first , its inability to accommodate conscientious objections to the society 's basic appreciation of justice or to emerging moral or ethical principles ( such as respect for the rights of the natural environment ) which are not yet part of it and second , the difficulty of predictably and consistently determining that a majority decision is just or unjust . Conscientious objection ( also called conscientious refusal or evasion ) to obeying a law , should not arise from unreasoning , naive \" traditional conscience \" , for to do so merely encourages infantile abdication of responsibility to calibrate the law against moral or human rights norms and disrespect for democratic institutions . Instead it should be based on \" critical conscience ' – seriously thought out , conceptually mature , personal moral or religious beliefs held to be fundamentally incompatible ( that is , not merely inconsistent on the basis of selfish desires , whim or impulse ) , for example , either with all laws requiring conscription for military service , or legal compulsion to fight for or financially support the State in a particular war . A famous example arose when Henry David Thoreau the author of Walden was willingly jailed for refusing to pay a tax because he profoundly disagreed with a government policy and was frustrated by the corruption and injustice of the democratic machinery of the state . A more recent case concerned Kimberly Rivera , a private in the US Army and mother of four children who , having served 3 months in Iraq War decided the conflict was immoral and sought refugee status in Canada in 2012 ( see List of Iraq War resisters ) , but was deported and arrested in the US ."

Led by the city 's Bureau of Environmental Services , the combined groups in 2001 produced the Johnson Creek Restoration Plan to reduce flooding , improve water quality , and improve fish and wildlife habitat . Goals varied from section to section along the creek and included controlling storm water runoff , reducing erosion , replacing or mitigating impervious surfaces , and protecting riparian zones .

During and after the massive Ottoman invasion in north @-@ eastern Bulgaria in 1388 , sources suggest that relations between the two brothers were uneasy . As a result of the Ottoman success in the 1388 campaign and the resulting changes of the balance of power , Ivan Sratsimir had to become an Ottoman vassal and to accept an Ottoman garrison in Vidin . Ivan Sratsimir remained inactive while the Ottomans destroyed the remains of the Tarnovo Tsardom – Tarnovo fell in 1393 and Ivan Shishman was killed in 1395 . In 1396 Ivan Sratsimir joined the Christian crusade organised by the Hungarian king Sigismund . When the crusader army reached Vidin the Bulgarian ruler opened the gates and surrendered the Ottoman garrison . The Ottoman garrison of Oryahovo tried to resist but the local Bulgarians managed to capture it . However , the Christian army suffered a heavy defeat on 25 September in the battle of Nicopolis and the victorious Ottoman sultan Bayezid I immediately marched to Vidin and seized it by the end of 1396 or the beginning of 1397 .

The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to ceruloplasmin . This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys , eyes and brain . In the brain , most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia , particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus ( together called the lenticular nucleus ) ; these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation . Damage to these areas , again by Fenton chemistry , produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson 's disease ."

Shortly after purchasing the land , he enclosed it and erected several dwellings , including his home , Pikadilly Hall .

Some of the most notable stately homes in London were built on the northern side of the street during this period , including Clarendon House and Burlington House in 1664 .

The position of the husband of an epikleros was closest to that of an epitropos , or the guardian of an orphan 's property , who was likewise responsible to the orphan for his care of the property when the orphan came of age .

    "text": "Jehovah 's Witnesses believe that Jesus Christ began to rule in heaven as king of God 's kingdom in October 1914 , and that Satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in \" woe \" to humanity . They believe that Jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of \" signs \" . They base this belief on a rendering of the Greek word parousia — usually translated as \" coming \" when referring to Christ — as \" presence \" . They believe Jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . They thus depart from the mainstream Christian belief that the \" second coming \" of Matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans ."

It commented that \" From the comprehensive nature of the Règne Animal , embracing equally the structure and history of all the existing and extinct races of animals , this work may be viewed as an epitome of M. Cuvier 's zoological labours ; and it presents the best outline , which exists in any language , of the present state of zoology and comparative anatomy . \" The review continued less favourably , however , that \" We cannot help thinking that the science of comparative anatomy is now so far advanced , as to afford the means of distributing the animal kingdom on some more uniform and philosophical principles , — as on the modifications of those systems or functions which are most general in the animal economy \" . The review argued that the vertebrate division relied on the presence of a vertebral column , \" a part of the organization of comparatively little importance in the economy \" ; it found the basis of the mollusca on \" the general softness of the body \" no better ; the choice of the presence of articulations no better either , in the third division ; while in the fourth it points out that while the echinoderms may fit well into the chosen scheme , it did not apply \" to the entozoa , zoophyta , and infusoria , which constitute by much the greatest portion of this division . \" But the review notes that \" the general distribution of the animal kingdom established by M. Cuvier in this work , are founded on a more extensive and minute survey of the organization than had ever before been taken , and many of the most important distinctions among the orders and families are the result of his own researches . \""

The ten stories reviewed by Oliphant were found and plans were made for Odyssey Publications to publish a paperback edition of Thrill Book material including these stories along with some reprints . The following year another group of Thrill Book manuscripts was found in the Syracuse collection , including Leinster 's \" The Great Catastrophe \" and La Spina 's \" The Bracelet \" , and the planned contents of the anthology were revised to include some of this material . None of the Francis Stevens stories were found in either group of manuscripts . One story , \" As It Is Written \" , by De Lysle Ferree Cass , was misidentified by Murray as the work of Clark Ashton Smith , and this led to delays in publication as Odyssey made separate plans to publish the story under Smith 's name . The misidentification was not discovered until after the story appeared in print in 1982 . Four years later , Odyssey went out of business , and the anthology of Thrill Book material never appeared ."

Commander Bey 's other two ships were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition , so he decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1 ."

The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen ; the structure of the claspers varies between species , and may help to prevent interspecific mating . The pair flies in tandem with the male in front , typically perching on a twig or plant stem . The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male 's secondary genitalia , while the male uses his \" tail \" claspers to grip the female behind the head : this distinctive posture is called the \" heart \" or \" wheel \" ; the pair may also be described as being \" in cop \" ."

The Romans advanced through Thapsus , Leptis Parva and Hadrumetum to Grasse , where for the first time they engaged in a skirmish with the scouts of Gelimer 's army . After exchanging blows , both parties retired to their camps . From Grasse , Belisarius turned his army westwards , cutting across the neck of the Cape Bon peninsula .

Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects , in turn , evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins . Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators . Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors . This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics . Over time , this has led to complex groups of coevolved species . Conversely , some interactions between plants and insects , like pollination , are beneficial to both organisms . Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems ."

Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway . The stations ' coal handling facility was fitted with a Merry go Round ( MGR ) coal delivery system in 1981 , after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard . This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train . Because of site space restrictions , a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed , so instead of being able to move continuously , trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track ; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end , before slowly moving over the unloading track hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site . Towards the end of the station 's operation , coal was more frequently brought in by road . All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area to the north of the power stations . This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination . The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts , which travelled over the Bedlington @-@ Cambois Road separating the two sites , before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary ."

Oxygen works as an antidote as it increases the removal of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin , in turn providing the body with normal levels of oxygen . The prevention of poisoning is a significant public health issue . Domestic carbon monoxide poisoning can be prevented by early detection with the use of household carbon monoxide detectors . Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal poisoning in many countries . Historically , it was also commonly used as a method to commit suicide , usually by deliberately inhaling the exhaust fumes of a running car engine . Modern automobiles , even with electronically controlled combustion and catalytic converters , can still produce levels of carbon monoxide which will kill if enclosed within a garage or if the tailpipe is obstructed ( for example , by snow ) and exhaust gas cannot escape normally . Carbon monoxide poisoning has also been speculated as a possible cause of apparent haunted houses ; symptoms such as delirium and hallucinations may have led people suffering poisoning to think they have seen ghosts or to believe their house is haunted ."

In their description of Voalavo , Carleton and Goodman argued that , although closely related , Eliurus and Voalavo form separate monophyletic groups ; but a 1999 molecular phylogenetic study by Sharon Jansa and colleagues , who compared cytochrome b sequences among nesomyines and other rodents , found that Voalavo gymnocaudus was more closely related to Eliurus grandidieri than to other species of Eliurus .

However , tissue samples of Eliurus petteri , a species that is thought to be closely related to E. grandidieri , were not available , so this species could not be included in the study .

Invasive species often coexist with native species for an extended time , and gradually , the superior competitive ability of an invasive species becomes apparent as its population grows larger and denser and it adapts to its new location ."
