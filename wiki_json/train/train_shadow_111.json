This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider .

Its size limited the possible crew to three — a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret — which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as loader for the 2 @-@ pounder , which caused delays in combat ; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible .

The twins Atreus and Thyestes with their descendants played the leading role in the tragedy of the devolution of power in Mycenae ."

The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge , the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus , which is always an outer electron in main group elements . The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels . Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge ( + 1 ) , the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus . Since this distance increases down the group , the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases . ( This trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital , bringing francium 's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non @-@ relativistic calculations . This makes francium 's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus , increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium . )"

Anderson praised Tony Barwick 's script , citing Blue and Symphony 's romantic relationship and the underlying tension between Blue and Colonel White as examples of Barwick 's \" humanisation \" of the puppet characters .

The species is monogamous , with pairs remaining together throughout the year . The length of the gestational period has been estimated from as short as four months to as long as seven months . The former estimate is supported by observations in the Ituri Rainforest ( Democratic Republic of Congo ) . Births occur throughout the year , though the birth rate might fall in the dry season . The calf can start moving about on its own within 20 minutes of birth , and is nursed thrice a day . It is kept in hiding for most of the time . The nursing intervals become irregular towards weaning , which occurs at 2 @.@ 5 to 3 months . Males visit their mates occasionally , though they disappear for about a month after the calf 's birth to probably protect the calf . A postpartum oestrus occurs three to five days after the birth ."

A study of the gastric contents of marsh shrews in Oregon indicated that at least 25 % of their diet is aquatic , including insect larvae , slugs and snails , mayfly naiads and other , unidentified invertebrates . Other researchers have reported that their diet may also include aquatic insects ( water beetles and stonefly nymphs ) , craneflies , ground beetles , spiders , harvestmen , centipedes , earthworms , slugs and small terrestrial snails . The marsh shrew swims , making short dives in search of food ; its mobile snout , whiskers and lips are used to find and capture underwater prey . Before eating , it returns to land . Air trapped in its fur provides buoyancy , and marsh shrews can run for as long as 3 to 5 seconds along the top of the water . According to mammalogist Donald Pattie , they can \" scull on the surface like whirligig beetles \" . The air trapped in its fur gives it a silvery sheen . On land , its foreleg and opposite hind leg move at the same time ."

Later , Lucien Quélet erected a separate monotypic genus Phlogiotis for Jacquin 's species , whereas Julius Oscar Brefeld placed it ( as Gyrocephalus rufa ) in Persoon 's small genus Gyrocephalus ( rejected name for Gyromitra ) . The proper name for the fungus was debated for some time , as the name Guepinia is a homonym ( pointed out by Fries in 1828 ) , because it had been used by Toussaint Bastard in 1812 for a genus of flowering plants in the Cruciferae family . To further complicate matters , the generic name Teesdalia , originally considered to have priority over the name Guepinia for the plant genus , was later determined to have been validly published after Guepinia , rendering Teesdalia an illegitimate name . In 1982 , changes in the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature gave protected status to all names adopted by Fries in the Elenchus Fungorum , and established Guepinia as the correct genus name ."

Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist , but made a crucial mistake . Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg , a Member of Parliament for Beverly , was legally married to another man , prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory . Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error . Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence . Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication , which could have threatened Hogg 's legal position . Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt , who convinced Gregory not to publish . John Edward Johnson died in 1840 , ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status . Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to , to avoid revealing their situation ."

Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony , but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany . Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia . He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues , like navigation rights on the Rhine . The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy , where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army . On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia . Metternich wanted no rash change of course , and at first there was little impact on the Congress . Finally , on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting . On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150 @,@ 000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances .

For example , Graham Budd 's analyses of Kerygmachela in 1993 and of Opabinia in 1996 convinced him that these animals were similar to onychophorans and to various Early Cambrian \" lobopods \" , and he presented an \" evolutionary family tree \" that showed these as \" aunts \" and \" cousins \" of all arthropods . These changes made the scope of the term \" arthropod \" unclear , and Claus Nielsen proposed that the wider group should be labelled \" Panarthropoda \" ( \" all the arthropods \" ) while the animals with jointed limbs and hardened cuticles should be called \" Euarthropoda \" ( \" true arthropods \" ) ."

Many of the first artists were attracted to the region because of the 1826 tragedy of the Willey family , in which nine people lost their lives in a mudslide . These early works portrayed a dramatic and untamed mountain wilderness . Dr. Robert McGrath describes a Thomas Cole ( 1801 – 1848 ) painting titled Distant View of the Slide that Destroyed the Willey Family thus : \" ... an array of broken stumps and errant rocks , together with a gathering storm , suggest the wildness of the site while evoking an appropriate ambient of darkness and desolation \" . The images stirred the imagination of Americans , primarily from the large cites of the northeast , who traveled to the White Mountains to view the scenes for themselves . Others soon followed : innkeepers , writers , scientists , and more artists . The White Mountains became a major attraction for tourists from the New England states and beyond .

    "text": "Shi ( simplified Chinese : 诗 ; traditional Chinese : 詩 ; pinyin : shī ; Wade – Giles : shih ) Is the main type of Classical Chinese poetry . Within this form of poetry the most important variations are \" folk song \" styled verse ( yuefu ) , \" old style \" verse ( gushi ) , \" modern style \" verse ( jintishi ) . In all cases , rhyming is obligatory . The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style , and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular . For the other variations of shi poetry , generally either a four line ( quatrain , or jueju ) or else an eight line poem is normal ; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming . The line length is scanned by according number of characters ( according to the convention that one character equals one syllable ) , and are predominantly either five or seven characters long , with a caesura before the final three syllables . The lines are generally end @-@ stopped , considered as a series of couplets , and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device . The \" old style \" verse ( gushi ) is less formally strict than the jintishi , or regulated verse , which , despite the name \" new style \" verse actually had its theoretical basis laid as far back to Shen Yue , in the 5th or 6th century , although not considered to have reached its full development until the time of Chen Zi 'ang ( 661 – 702 ) A good example of a poet known for his gushi poems is Li Bai . Among its other rules , the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem , including the use of set patterns of the four tones of Middle Chinese The basic form of jintishi ( lushi ) has eight lines in four couplets , with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets . The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words . Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction , full of allusion , and can have a wide range of subject , including history and politics . One of the masters of the form was Du Fu , who wrote during the Tang Dynasty ( 8th century ) ."

Coenwulf asserted in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jaenberht , the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time of the division ; but Leo responded that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia . The comments of both Coenwulf and Leo are partisan , as each had his own reasons for representing the situation as they did : Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese , while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa . Coenwulf 's desire to move the southern archbishopric to London would have been influenced by the situation in Kent , where Archbishop Æthelheard had been forced to flee by Eadberht Præn .

While Darwin considered Wallace 's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection , historians have pointed out differences . Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders , and emphasised competition between individuals ; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding , and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions .

    "text": "The doctrine of wrongful delegation is sometimes said to be a reflection of the Latin maxim delegatus non potest delegare ( a delegate cannot appoint another ) , which means that a body to which or person to whom power was delegated by Parliament cannot further delegate the power to another . Academics have submitted that the maxim does not state a rule of law , but is \" at most a rule of construction \" and in applying it to a statute \" there , of course must be a consideration of the language of the whole enactment and of its purposes and objects \" . Thus , in reality , there is no such principle as delegatus non potest delegare ; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of cases but is sometimes used as a convenient label . Consequently , in most cases the courts have adopted such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern governmental agencies . For statutory powers , the important question is whether it is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A 's authority by B. The maxim is merely the pencil with which the court is able to draw the line between authorized and unauthorized sub @-@ delegation , and the courts must then ask whether statutory discretion remains in the hands of the proper authority , or whether some other person purports to exercise it . Thus where an Act said that an inspector of nuisances \" may procure any sample \" of goods for analysis , it was held that the inspector might validly send his assistant to buy a sample of coffee , as he had in no way authorized his assistant to exercise the discretion legally reposed in himself .

The study found that band instability was high , with mares not generally forming close relationships with each other and commonly switching which stallion they banded with , and juveniles dispersing quickly .

Also in the 1940s , the road was widened west into Denville , and a bypass of downtown Denville , including an interchange at Route 5N ( now Route 53 ) was built . The Route 6 designation was dropped in favor of U.S. Route 46 in the 1953 renumbering ."

There are two possible dates for the construction ; it is possible that William the Conqueror built a castle at Cardiff as early as 1081 on his return from his pilgrimage to St Davids . Alternatively the first Norman fortification may have been constructed around 1091 by Robert Fitzhamon , the lord of Gloucester . Fitzhamon invaded the region in 1090 , and used the castle as a base for the occupation of the rest of southern Glamorgan over the next few years . The site was close to the sea and could be easily supplied by ship , was well protected by the Rivers Taff and Rhymney and also controlled the old Roman road running along the coast ."

Initially thought of as some form of armor , they appear to have been too fragile and ill @-@ placed for defensive purposes , leaving the animal 's sides unprotected . The plates ' large size suggests that they may have served to increase the apparent height of the animal , either to intimidate enemies or to impress other members of the same species , in some form of sexual display , although both male and female specimens seemed to have had the same plates . More recently , researchers have proposed that they may have helped to control the body temperature of the animal , in a similar way to the sails of the pelycosaurs Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus ( and modern elephant and rabbit ears ) . The plates had blood vessels running through grooves and air flowing around the plates would have cooled the blood . The publication of \" Growth and Function of Stegosaurus Plates \" by Buffrénil , et al. in 1986 marked a major step out of the realm of speculation and into the realm of science , with its microscopic analyses of multiple Stegosaurus plate specimens , proving unequivocally \" extreme vascularization of the outer layer of bone \" , which was seen by Buffrénil as further evidence the plates \" acted as thermoregulatory devices \" . Later , more comprehensive histological surveys of plate microstructure attributed the vascularization to the need to transport nutrients for rapid plate growth , asserting the plates ' physiology , if beneficial , was a side benefit secondary to their primary function , identification and display ."

During the final hours of the battle , Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens was approaching the Union lines at Norfolk , Virginia , under a flag of truce . Although his formal instructions from Confederate President Jefferson Davis had limited his powers to negotiate on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters , historian James M. McPherson speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures . Davis had hoped that Stephens would reach Washington from the south while Lee 's victorious army was marching toward it from the north . President Lincoln , upon hearing of the Gettysburg results , refused Stephens 's request to pass through the lines . Furthermore , when the news reached London , any lingering hopes of European recognition of the Confederacy were finally abandoned . Henry Adams wrote , \" The disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success . It is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end . \""

After the airfield on Guadalcanal had been seized from the enemy on August 8 , Col. Edson , with a force of 800 men , was assigned to the occupation and defense of a ridge dominating the jungle on either side of the airport . Facing a formidable Japanese attack which , augmented by infiltration , had crashed through our front lines , he , by skillful handling of his troops , successfully withdrew his forward units to a reserve line with minimum casualties . When the enemy , in a subsequent series of violent assaults , engaged our force in desperate hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with bayonets , rifles , pistols , grenades , and knives , Col.

He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006 , and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties .

This was for several reasons ; firstly , the cruel punishment usually meted out to felons to set an example would not have the same effect on the insane . Secondly , as felonies required a mens rea , an insane person could not be guilty because they did not have the capacity to hold a mens rea .

Unrefined immediacy is characterized by immediate cravings for desire and satisfaction through enjoyments that do not require effort or personal cultivation ( e.g. alcohol , drugs , casual sex , sloth , etc . ) Refined immediacy is characterized by planning how best to enjoy life aesthetically . The \" theory \" of social prudence given in Crop Rotation is an example of refined immediacy . Instead of mindless hedonistic tendencies , enjoyments are contemplated and \" cultivated \" for maximum pleasure . However , both the refined and unrefined aesthetes still accept the fundamental given conditions of their life , and do not accept the responsibility to change it . If things go wrong , the aesthete simply blames existence , rather than one 's self , assuming some unavoidable tragic consequence of human existence and thus claims life is meaningless . Kierkegaard spoke of immediacy this way in his sequel to Either / Or , Stages on Life 's Way ,"

    "text": "The Canadian National Vimy Memorial site has considerable sociocultural significance for Canada . The idea that Canada 's national identity and nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely published in military and general histories of Canada . Historian Denise Thomson suggests that the construction of the Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period . Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War , while expressing the enormous impact of war in general . Hucker also suggest that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation 's determination to remember Canada 's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War . The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada recognized the importance of the site by recommending its designation as a National Historic Site of Canada ; it was so designated , one of only two outside of Canada , in 1997 . The other is the Beaumont @-@ Hamel Newfoundland Memorial , also in France . Remembrance has also taken other forms : the Vimy Foundation , having been established to preserve and promote Canada 's First World War legacy as symbolized by the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge , and Vimy Ridge Day , to commemorate the deaths and casualties during the battle . Local Vimy resident Georges Devloo spent 13 years until his death in 2009 offering car rides to Canadian tourists to and from the memorial at no charge , as a way of paying tribute to the Canadians who fought at Vimy . The memorial is not without its critics . Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified . Visually , Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures at the top of the pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base . Textually , she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument ."

However , the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until the 1660s . When conjoined with Christiaan Huygens ' newly discovered law of centrifugal force , it enabled Isaac Newton , Edmund Halley , and perhaps Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them . This refuted the traditional assumption of scholastic physics that the power of gravitational attraction remained constant with distance whenever it applied between two bodies , such as was assumed by Kepler and also by Galileo in his mistaken universal law that gravitational fall is uniformly accelerated , and also by Galileo 's student Borrelli in his 1666 celestial mechanics ."

The following year , Charlemagne died and Louis was made ruler of the Holy Roman Empire . He brought Claudius to Aachen , the empire 's capital city . There Claudius gave exegetical lectures to the emperor and the court and was even urged to put his lectures in writing by the emperor himself . Claudius was a member of an elite circle of secular and ecclesiastic politicians and authorities and a creatura della corte di Aquisgrana ( \" creature of the court of Aachen \" ) . In 817 , he was sent by Louis to Turin to act as bishop . It has been suggested that the appointment of a theologian and scholar to a post such as Turin , which had attendant military duties due to the threat of Saracen raids , was largely based on the need for an imperial supporter in Italy in light of the rebellion of Bernard . Bernard was the illegitimate son of King Pepin , the third son of Charlemagne . Louis gave Italy to his eldest son Lothair when the empire was partitioned among his three sons in 817 . Bernard rebelled against his uncle with the support of Bishop Theodulf of Orléans .

As infection ( specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis , and are common triggers for HRS , specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS . Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable . The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided . In addition , many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications ( such as some antibiotics ) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS . Also , large volume paracentesis — which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort — may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS , and should be avoided in individuals at risk . The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large volume paracentesis , and may prevent HRS . Conversely , in individuals with very tense ascites , it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins ."

His next effort , Mr. Sampath , was the first book exhibiting this modified approach . However , it still draws from some of his own experiences , particularly the aspect of starting his own journal ; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events . Soon after , he published The Financial Expert , considered to be his masterpiece and hailed as one of the most original works of fiction in 1951 . The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius , Margayya , related to him by his brother . The next novel , Waiting for the Mahatma , loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi , deals with the protagonist 's romantic feelings for a woman , when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma . The woman , named Bharti , is a loose parody of Bharati , the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi 's discourses . While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement , the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual , narrated with Narayan 's usual dose of irony ."

The structure of the film follows two men on opposite sides of the law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil , Wong Hoi , a Triad boss . Li and Ah Jong 's relationship was influenced by the Spy vs. Spy comics from Mad Magazine . Woo recalled \" When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon – I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other , but deep in their heart , they are still friendly , and the idea came from that . \" Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points . Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong . The focus on male friendships in Woo 's film have been interpreted as homoerotic . Woo has responded to these statements stating \" People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie ....

    "text": "With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance , a striking account , in relation to man , will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North Siberia , by Von Wrangell . He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot , whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice , with incessant changes of direction , and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea . He states ( but I quote only from memory of many years standing ) that he , an experienced surveyor , and using a compass , failed to do that which these savages easily effected . Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us . We must bear in mind that neither a compass , nor the north star , nor any other such sign , suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country , or through hummocky ice , when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable , unless the deviations are allowed for , or a sort of \" dead reckoning \" is kept . All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree , and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent , though probably in an unconscious manner . This is effected chiefly , no doubt , by eyesight , but partly , perhaps , by the sense of muscular movement , in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed ( and some men much better than others ) for a short distance in a nearly straight line , or turn at right angles , or back again . The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly disarranged in very old and feeble persons , and the feeling of strong distress which , as I know , has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction , leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction ."

The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale @-@ oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes . According to a survey conducted by the RAND Corporation , the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States ( comprising a mine , retorting plant , upgrading plant , supporting utilities , and spent shale reclamation ) , would range between US $ 70 – 95 ( $ 440 – 600 / m3 , adjusted to 2005 values ) . This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency . In order to run a profitable operation , the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels . The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex . The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35 – 70 % after producing its first 500 million barrels ( 79 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) . Assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day ( 4 @.@ 0 × 10 ^ 3 m3 / d ) during each year after the start of commercial production , RAND predicts the costs would decline to $ 35 – 48 per barrel ( $ 220 – 300 / m3 ) within 12 years .

Cadets from the school defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865 , leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces . The students were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson , a graduate of Virginia Military Institute , who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college . After the fall of the Confederacy , campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose . In recognition of the cadets , and their pivotal role in the battle , the Florida State University Army ROTC cadet corps displays a battle streamer bearing the words \" NATURAL BRIDGE 1865 \" with its flag . The FSU Army ROTC is one of only four collegiate military units in the United States with permission to display such a pennant ."

With a limited amount of space for burials , the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials , and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage . From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed , and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits . Despite this practice , by the mid 17th century the city was running seriously short of burial space . A proposal by Christopher Wren to use the reconstruction following the 1666 Great Fire of London as an opportunity to cease burials in the churchyards and establish new cemeteries outside the city was approved by the King and Parliament but vetoed by the Corporation of London , and burials continued at the newly rebuilt churches ."

This brought a culmination to the surrogacy story arc , which began in the fourth season ; it was developed to accommodate Lisa Kudrow 's real life pregnancy . When Kudrow accepted the surrogate mother storyline , the idea of having more than one baby was \" comically funny \" to Kauffman , and giving birth to triplets or \" their brother 's children \" was something never seen on television . Phoebe 's pregnancy gave the writers incredible license for her to \" be just outrageously mean and still have it be funny \" .

Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise , as they would be the party 's supports . Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3 : the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited . The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue , due to his volatile nature . The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation ."

The type species , A. remotus , is known from a partial skull and three foot bones recovered from Mongolian sediments which were deposited in a humid floodplain about 70 million years ago . These remains were named and described by Soviet paleontologist Sergei Kurzanov in 1976 . A second species , A. altai , known from a much more complete skeleton , was named and described by Stephen L. Brusatte and colleagues in 2009 . Its relationships to other tyrannosaurid genera are unclear , with some evidence supporting a hypothesis that Alioramus is closely related to the contemporary species Tarbosaurus bataar ."

Fish discussed Nelson 's concepts within the framework of changing viewpoints on free speech through varying mediums of communication including online fora and speech in other venues : \" How to weigh these elements also figures in Nelson 's consideration of the Internet with its capacity for international communications — how to weigh the intent of an Internet speaker against an unintended hostile foreign audience shielded by its own local laws or even remote , but culturally distinctive , domestic audiences for that matter \" . He posits that Nelson 's plurality theory contains elements which would impact free speech in the future : \" What Nelson terms ' incommensurable values ' embedded in remote legal cultures not perceived by the speaker requires close attention to context , speaker 's intention or lack thereof , and ' uptake ' on the part of distant audiences . His is indeed a theory fraught with possibilities both favorable and unfavorable to an expanded scope for the contents of free speech \" ."

The wedding was widely reported and until the end of the decade the couple were heavily involved in social events . They were popular guests at functions , and became notable figures in the fashionable society of the upper classes . In 1923 , Chapman joined a Kent brewery , H & G Symonds . His wife believed that his choice of a career working in the alcohol trade made his life difficult and contributed to his heavy drinking . The social duties associated with his job also contributed to his increased weight and failing fitness in the later part of his cricket career . Further problems arose through his fame ; as he wanted to keep people happy , he drank frequently and attended many social functions . Cricket writer Ivo Tennant believes that Chapman 's \" taste for conviviality was his undoing \" . He always appeared happy , but Gibson observes \" that is the way some men disguise their unhappiness \" , and Lemmon suggests that Chapman was seeking acceptance and felt lonely at heart . According to Lemmon , by the end of the Second World War , Chapman was largely living in the past , and that \" mentally he was still in the happy days of University cricket . \""

Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers ' forces in 1217 after a siege , there is no indication that Peveril was assaulted , and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender . Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King Henry III came of age . When the time came he was reluctant to hand over the property , and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223 . Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive , they do not specify how the money was spent . As a result , it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work ; however , Richard Eales , who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook , suggests that there were two periods of building , when sums spent were larger than usual : £ 54 in 1204 – 1207 and £ 67 in 1210 – 1212 .

Therefore , it 's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku – at the start of the 20th century , this bay town on the Caspian was producing more than 50 percent of the world 's supply of oil . Just like today , the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work . In 1919 , during the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic , a documentary The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence was filmed on Azerbaijan 's independence day , 28 May , and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku . After the Soviet power was established in 1920 , Nariman Narimanov , Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan , signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan 's cinema . This also influenced the creation of Azerbaijani animation ."

    "text": "During the Middle Ages , much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire – an ancient division of the county of Lancashire . Salfordshire encompassed several parishes and townships , some of which , like Rochdale , were important market towns and centres of England 's woollen trade . The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production , which encouraged a system of cross @-@ regional trade . In the late @-@ 18th century , the Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system ; mechanisation enabled the industrialisation of the region 's textile trade , triggering rapid growth in the cotton industry and expansion in ancillary trades . Infrastructure such as rows of terraced housing , factories and roads were constructed to house labour , transport goods , and produce cotton goods on an industrial scale for a global market . The townships in and around Manchester began expanding \" at an astonishing rate \" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in industrial textile production and processing . This population increase resulted in the \" vigourous concentric growth \" of a conurbation between Manchester and an arc of surrounding mill towns , formed from a steady acretion of houses , factories and transport infrastructure . Places such as Bury , Oldham and Bolton played a central economic role nationally , and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive cotton @-@ producing towns in the world . However , it was Manchester that was the most populous settlement , a major city , the world 's largest marketplace for cotton goods , and the natural centre of its region . By 1835 \" Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world \" ; and by 1848 urban sprawl had fused the city to its surrounding towns and hinterland to form a single continuous conurbation . In the 1910s , local government reforms to administer this conurbation as a single entity were proposed ."

Donna White stated that Left Hand was one of the seminal works of science fiction , as important as Frankenstein , by Mary Shelley , which is often described as the very first science fiction novel . Left Hand has been a focus of literary critique of Le Guin 's work , along with her Earthsea fiction and utopian fiction . The novel was also a personal milestone for Le Guin , with critics calling it her \" first contribution to feminism . \" It was one of her most popular books for many years after its publication ."

Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself , this was an important commission ."

And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the Arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison . \" Bechdel , as the narrator , considers her relationship to her father through the myth of Daedalus and Icarus . As a child , she confused her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family seen in the cartoons of Charles Addams . Bruce Bechdel 's suicide is discussed with reference to Albert Camus ' novel A Happy Death and essay The Myth of Sisyphus . His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald , and the narrator suggests that Bruce Bechdel modeled elements of his life after Fitzgerald 's , as portrayed in the biography The Far Side of Paradise . His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the Henry James novels Washington Square and The Portrait of a Lady . Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress , and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage . She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of The Taming of the Shrew , and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was \" a harbinger of my parents ' later marriage \" . Helen Bechdel 's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of The Importance of Being Earnest is shown in some detail ; Bruce Bechdel is compared with Oscar Wilde . His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to Marcel Proust 's In Search of Lost Time . The father and daughter 's artistic and obsessive @-@ compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to E. H. Shepard 's illustrations for The Wind in the Willows . Bruce and Alison Bechdel exchange hints about their sexualities by exchanging memoirs : the father gives the daughter Earthly Paradise , an autobiographical collection of the writings of Colette ; shortly afterwards , in what Alison Bechdel describes as \" an eloquent unconscious gesture \" , she leaves a library copy of Kate Millett 's memoir Flying for him .

The first known use of this word was in 1539 .

He argued that since Australia was also an island nation , it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade . If Australia could be defeated without an invasion , the defence of Australia had to be a naval one . Colonel John Lavarack , who had attended the Imperial Defence College class of 1928 with Shedden , disagreed . Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult , and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure . When Richmond attacked the Labor Party 's position in an article in British Army Quarterly in 1933 , Lavarack wrote a rebuttal . In 1936 , the leader of the opposition John Curtin read an article by Wynter in the House of Representatives . Wynter 's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post . Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939 , Prime Minister Robert Menzies appointed a British officer , Lieutenant General Ernest Squires , to replace Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff .

Taylor 's property is valuable , and at the opening of the play a financier purchases it at a satisfactory figure . To close the deal , Taylor is obliged to go to the financier 's hotel , and there he attracts the attention of four pretty young girl guests . One of them , Lou Bennett ( played by Violet Heming ) , asks John to introduce Tom . This John declines to do on the grounds that Tom is a woman hater .

Assailed by a tremendous volume of small @-@ arms , mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave , Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and , personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit , continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance . Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action , he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy , reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades , pinned down his unit for the second time . Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack , Sergeant Cole , armed solely with a pistol and one grenade , coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes .

Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad , Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position , thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications , continue the advance and seize the objective . By his dauntless initiative , unfaltering courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action , Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades , and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service .

Though these genres were not largely popular in the sense of selling many records to mainstream audiences , they were examples of popular music , as opposed to folk or classical music . In the early 1970s , African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City developed hip hop culture , which produced a style of music also called hip hop . At roughly the same time , Latinos , especially Cubans and Puerto Ricans , in New York also innovated salsa music , which combined many forms of Latin music with R & B and rock . The genres of punk rock and heavy metal were most closely associated with the United Kingdom in the 1970s , while various American derivatives evolved later in the decade and into the 1980s . Meanwhile , Detroit slowly evolved a series of electronic music genres like house and techno that later became a major part of popular music worldwide ."

At Anzac an offensive would be made against the Sari Bair range by advancing through rough and thinly defended terrain , north of the Anzac perimeter . This would be achieved by an attack on \" Baby 700 \" from the Nek by dismounted Australian light horsemen from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade , in concert with an attack on Chunuk Bair summit by New Zealanders from the New Zealand Infantry Brigade , who would traverse \" Rhododendron Ridge \" , the \" Apex \" and the \" Farm \" . Hill 971 would be attacked by a combined force drawn from the Gurkhas of the 29th Indian Brigade and the Australians of the 4th Infantry Brigade .

A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving . This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle . It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle 's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down . From the perspective of the person in the car , the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest : It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction . Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest , the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable .

The North Sea ice sheet deposited huge amounts of boulder clay as it retreated and this subsequently formed a wet and swampy area which became the plain of Holderness . Another ice sheet in the Vale of York retreated at the same time leaving thick glacial deposits and two prominent moraines to the west of the Wolds . These Vale of York deposits also formed wetlands . The Wolds themselves were largely ice @-@ free , well drained , chalk uplands . Gradually the tundra conditions that had existed as the ice retreated gave way to vegetation that could support grazing fauna . Because a lot of water was still locked in the northern ice sheets , sea level was much lower than in the present day and an area of land stretched eastwards to the low countries ."

Many of the fellows in the past were Welsh , since when new fellowships were created by benefactions ( often by people of Welsh descent ) there was frequently a stipulation that the recipients would be related to the donor or come from a specified part of Wales . These specific limitations were removed as part of reforms of Oxford University during the 19th century . Between 1571 and 1915 , only one Principal ( Francis Howell , 1657 – 1660 ) was not from Wales or of Welsh descent ."

The only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra . Well adapted to living around humans , it frequently lives and even breeds indoors , especially in factories , warehouses and zoos . It has been recorded breeding in an English coal mine 640 m ( 2 @,@ 100 ft ) below ground , and feeding on the Empire State Building 's observation deck at night .

    "text": "The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship . During the 1970s and early 1980s , a wave of explicit , graphic exploitation films caused controversy . Called \" video nasties \" within the UK , they ignited calls for censorship and stricter laws on home video releases , which were largely unregulated . Consequently , the British Board of Film Classification banned many popular cult films due to issues of sex , violence , and incitement to crime . Released during the cannibal boom , Cannibal Holocaust ( 1980 ) was banned in dozens of countries and caused the director to be briefly jailed over fears that it was a real snuff film . Although opposed to censorship , director Ruggero Deodato would later agree with cuts made by the BBFC which removed unsimulated animal killings , which limited the film 's distribution . Frequently banned films may introduce questions of authenticity as fans question whether they have seen a truly uncensored cut . Cult films have been falsely claimed to have been banned to increase their transgressive reputation and explain their lack of mainstream penetration . Marketing campaigns have also used such claims to raise interest among curious audiences . Home video has allowed cult film fans to import rare or banned films , finally giving them a chance to complete their collection with imports and bootlegs . Cult films previously banned are sometimes released with much fanfare and the fans assumed to be already familiar with the controversy . Personal responsibility is often highlighted , and a strong anti @-@ censorship message may be present . Previously lost scenes cut by studios can be re @-@ added and restore a director 's original vision , which draws similar fanfare and acclaim from fans .

After a brief visit to Fort Cumberland in September 1755 , Washington left , and chose to base himself at Winchester instead . He then embarked on recruiting expeditions to fill out the regiment , traveling often to Williamsburg . There , he complained bitterly to Dinwiddie about serving under Dagworthy . When Dagworthy refused to let the Virginians draw supplies from Fort Cumberland ( which , despite its location , had been paid for and provisioned by Virginia ) , Dinwiddie came to agree with Washington . He wrote to Massachusetts Governor William Shirley , who was acting as commander in chief after Braddock 's death , requesting royal commissions for Washington and other Virginia officers .

By 1929 the Baltimore Sun reported ships navigating the Channel blindly without making any reference to the cable .

There was no buildup to their marriage ; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife . The storyline 's fast pace angered Roache ; he once stressed : \" I was very cross about the whole thing . There was no wedding , she just arrived , no build @-@ up to it . It was just like an idea that was shoved in . I wasn 't happy . \" The storyline was unpopular with viewers , who did not approve of the wedding . Janet was already an unpopular character by then , because of her previous affairs with two other Coronation Street males . Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly . She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school . The situation saw Ken realise he was in a \" loveless marriage \" – a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness . The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed \" a series of spectacular rows \" , which saw Ken become violent towards Janet . One such row , which followed Ken 's discovery of Janet 's plans to send the twins to boarding school , was later used as an exercise in drama schools , which Roache deemed \" a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment . \""

This was identified as an exaggerated misconception as early as 1966 . Observational studies show that fishers will make repeated biting attacks on the face of a porcupine and kill it after about 25 – 30 minutes ."

As the large genus Boletus was carved up into smaller genera , Petter Karsten transferred it in 1881 to Tylopilus , a genus diagnosed by its pink spores and adnate tubes . T. felleus is the type species of Tylopilus , and the only member of the genus found in Europe . Synonyms include Boletus alutarius , described by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815 and later by Friedrich Wilhelm Gottlieb Rostkovius in 1844 , and Paul Christoph Hennings 's subsequent transfer of Fries 's taxon into Tylopilus , T. alutarius . Lucien Quélet placed the taxon in Dictyopus in 1886 and then Rhodoporus in 1888 , but neither of these genera are recognised today , the former having been merged into Boletus and the latter into Tylopilus . Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that T. felleus and many ( but not all ) other members of Tylopilus form a Tylopilus clade within a larger group informally called anaxoboletus in the Boletineae . Other clades in the group include the porcini and Strobilomyces clades , as well as three other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus , Xerocomellus and Boletus badius and relatives ."

So too , is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place \" rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct \" . She notes that for more than 300 years , Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription . They have worked on reconciliation , peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war . Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed , but technology has changed the nature of war . In a modern technological society she argues , there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace . War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought , women and children become targets . Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits , but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire . She writes that the arms race is driven by a \" technological imperative \" which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution :"

In 1932 , Friedrich von Huene renamed Dryptosaurus incrassatus , not considered a nomen dubium by him , to Albertosaurus incrassatus . Because he had identified Gorgosaurus with Albertosaurus , in 1970 , Russell also renamed Gorgosaurus sternbergi ( Matthew & Brown 1922 ) into Albertosaurus sternbergi and Gorgosaurus lancensis ( Gilmore 1946 ) into Albertosaurus lancensis . The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of Gorgosaurus libratus , the latter as either identical to Tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus Nanotyrannus . In 1988 , Gregory S. Paul based Albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton , specimen LACM 28345 , from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana .

When used in this way , it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure . Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism , the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality . An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled . Exactly how , if , or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate . In 2011 the International Resource Panel , hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals , ores , fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times its current rate of consumption – unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling . The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ( ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries ) . By comparison , the average person in India today consumes four tons per year .

Colour , in the Celtic languages , is perceived differently from the way it is seen and described in modern English . For example , in Scottish Gaelic the spectrum of colours was \" pastel rather than primary , gentle rather than bold . \" Colours were related to a landscape context in which blues , greens , greys and whites in particular were both more diverse and more differentiated than in English . People who relied on the system of transhumance for their livelihood gained the ability to assess the nutritional value of upland grasses from a distance before moving their stock to a summer shieling , and used appropriate colour terms for grasses which would become progressively more green as the spring advanced . Yellow , at least in Gaelic hill names , is not a bright colour . It describes hills which are distinguished by grasses such as Nardus stricta and Deschampsia flexuosa , both of which appear pale and bleached in winter . These grasses are common on the Helvellyn range , in an area where transhumance also used to be practiced . Nardus stricta in particular is an unpalatable and unproductive grass , and the Flora of Cumbria specifically notes a possible connection between areas of late snow cover and Nardus grassland at high altitudes in the Helvellyn range .

To augment these attacks , the French naval authorities dispatched squadrons of frigates to attack British trade routes . To counter these operations , the Royal Navy sent their own frigates to sea , sometimes in squadrons and sometimes on single patrols ."

Elected a member of the academy in 1867 , he concentrated on describing the structure and habits of moths and butterflies on the Pacific coast from British Columbia to Baja California . He went to visit John Muir in Yosemite Valley in June 1871 , with a letter of introduction from Jeanne Carr , the wife of California 's chief geologist Ezra S. Carr . The letter described Edwards as \" one of Nature 's truest and most devoted disciples \" , a sojourner who \" has the keys to the Kingdom \" . After the visit , Muir occasionally sent specimens from the Sierras to add to Edwards ' collection , carried to San Francisco by men such as geologist and artist Clarence King who were returning from Yosemite field study . Edwards presented a series of papers to the academy entitled Pacific Coast Lepidoptera , and classified two species as new to science . He named one Gyros muiri for Muir , with \" Hy .

In 1872 , Muir sent Edwards a letter , writing \" You are now in constant remembrance , because every flying flower is branded with your name . \" In 1873 , Edwards became the curator of entomology at the academy , and began to serve on the Publications Committee which produced the journal Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences . Beginning early that year , he befriended George Robert Crotch .

These are almost exclusively parasitoids , mostly utilising other insects as hosts . Another family , the Pompilidae , is a specialist parasitoid of spiders . Some wasps are even parasitoids of parasitoids ; the eggs of Euceros are laid beside lepidopteran larvae and the wasp larvae feed temporarily on their haemolymph , but if a parasitoid emerges from the host , the hyperparasites continue their life cycle inside the parasitoid . Parasitoids maintain their extreme diversity through narrow specialism . In Peru , 18 wasp species were found living on 14 fly species in only two species of Gurania climbing squash ."

Both Emma Wall of The Daily Telegraph and Christopher John Farley of The Wall Street Journal expressed approval of the choral arrangements , though Wall review observed that some of the ballads lack potency without their episodic context . Farley appreciated the \" emotional backstory \" given to the album by the television series , writing that it would \" evoke fond memories of favorite episodes \" for Glee fans . He found the better songs to be the ones which do not seem \" too polished \" , giving them a karaoke appeal . Entertainment Weekly 's Leah Greenblatt wrote that the soundtrack is essentially a karaoke album , describing the songs as \" unapologetically sincere \" — lacking the series ' subversive wit , but with \" a giddy sort of ' let 's put on a show ' charm \" .

After being taken down , Cromwell 's head was severed with eight blows , placed on a wooden spike on a 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) pole , and raised above Westminster Hall . Various conspiracy theories exist as to what happened to the body , including a rumour that Cromwell 's daughter Mary had it rescued from the pit and interred at her husband 's home at Newburgh Priory . A sealed stone vault was claimed to contain the remains of the headless Cromwell , but generations of the family have refused requests , including one from King Edward VII , to open it . Biographer John Morrill stated that it was more likely that Cromwell 's body was thrown into the pit at Tyburn , where it remained ."

In August 1874 , Philadelphia Mint superintendent James Pollock sent him patterns with an obverse showing a seated Liberty by Philadelphia sculptor Joseph A. Bailly with a reverse by chief engraver William Barber . Pollock did not approve Bailly 's proposal , deeming it too similar to the Seated Liberty design which was then on all domestic silver coinage , and so the new coin would too closely resemble the quarter . On March 31 , 1875 , after the enactment of Jones 's bill , Pollock sent Linderman additional patterns , all by Barber , and even more on April 12 . Pollock deprecated a reverse design with a shield , but Linderman liked it and stated that it would have been adopted but for the law requiring an eagle to appear on silver pieces larger than the dime . Linderman selected an obverse design near @-@ identical to the other silver coinage ( until 1916 , the silver coins were given similar appearances ) . That design , by the late chief engraver , Christian Gobrecht , following a concept by Thomas Sully and Titian Peale , was first used in 1836 and by 1840 was on all denominations of silver coins then being struck .

More generally , and more conceptually , the theorem yields a simple description of what \" basic functions \" , or , in abstract Hilbert spaces , what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space H , in the sense that the closure of their span ( i.e. , finite linear combinations and limits of those ) is the whole space . Such a set of functions is called a basis of H , its cardinality is known as the Hilbert space dimension . Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes , but together with the Gram @-@ Schmidt process , it enables one to construct a basis of orthogonal vectors . Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite @-@ dimensional Euclidean space ."

    "text": "After Emperor Wu called for the submission of memorial essays on how to improve the government , he favored that of the official Dong Zhongshu ( 179 – 104 BCE ) , a philosopher whom Kramers calls the first Confucian \" theologian \" . Dong 's synthesis fused together the ethical ideas of Confucius with the cosmological beliefs in yin and yang and Five Elements or Wuxing by fitting them into the same holistic , universal system which governed heaven , earth , and the world of man . Moreover , it justified the imperial system of government by providing it its place within the greater cosmos . Reflecting the ideas of Dong Zhongshu , Emperor Wu issued an edict in 136 BCE that abolished academic chairs other than those focused on the Confucian Five Classics . In 124 BCE Emperor Wu established the Imperial University , at which the academicians taught 50 students ; this was the incipient beginning of the civil service examination system refined in later dynasties . Although sons and relatives of officials were often privileged with nominations to office , those who did not come from a family of officials were not barred from entry into the bureaucracy . Rather , education in the Five Classics became the paramount prerequisite for gaining office ; as a result , the Imperial University was expanded dramatically by the 2nd century CE when it accommodated 30 @,@ 000 students . With Cai Lun 's ( d . 121 CE ) invention of the papermaking process in 105 CE , the spread of paper as a cheap writing medium from the Eastern Han period onwards increased the supply of books and hence the number of those who could be educated for civil service ."

The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze , and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \" the forts provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress of an increasing population burst out into open warfare . But I would not see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction \" ."

In spiders , the cephalothorax and abdomen are connected by a small cylindrical section , the pedicel .

The controversy over the style of the Scottish National Monument in 1816 led to the labelling of Greek temple motifs as \" pagan \" and relatively few columnar Greek churches were built after that in the capital . An exception was Archibald Elliot 's Broughton Church ( 1820 – 21 ) , which had a Doric temple front . More common in Edinburgh were churches that combined classical elements with other features , like the domed St George 's , Charlotte Square ( 1811 – 14 ) , executed by Robert Reid , or the Gracco @-@ Baroque of William Playfair 's St Stephen 's ( 1827 – 28 ) . In Glasgow there was a tradition of grafting porticoes on to existing meeting @-@ houses , which continued in Gillespie Graham 's West George Street Independent Church ( 1818 ) , which was criticised as \" popish \" , and John Baird I 's Greyfriars United Secession Church ( 1821 ) , which was fronted by a Roman Doric portico . Classical designs for the established Church included the redevelopment by William Stark of St George 's @-@ Tron Church ( 1807 – 08 ) , David Hamilton 's St Enoch 's Parish Church ( 1827 ) and St Paul 's Parish Church ( 1835 ) ."

The practical effects of his raiding were however insignificant : in three years he took just five East Indiamen and a handful of country ships , briefly terrorising the Andhra coast in 1804 but otherwise failing to cause major economic disruption to British trade . The only achievement of his cruise was to force Rainier 's squadron to operate in defence of British convoys and ports , preventing any offensive operations during Linois 's time in the Indian Ocean . The vast distances between friendly ports , the lack of sufficient food supplies or naval stores and the strength of British naval escorts after the initial months of war all played a part in Linois 's failings to fully exploit his opportunity , but the blame for his inadequate achievements has been consistently placed with Linois 's own personal leadership failings , both among his contemporaries and by historians . In battle Linois refused to place his ships in danger if it could be avoided , he spent considerable periods of the cruise refitting at French harbours and even when presented with an undefended target was reluctant to press his advantage ."

For example , injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates ( viscous fingering ) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow , with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns . This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy ( surface tension ) between different liquid crystal phases . This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature , and is so strong that usually facets appear . When temperature is changed one of the phases grows , forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change . Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion , anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions , which has also an effect on the final shape ."

Where the official Press Bureau failed ( it had no statutory powers until April 1916 ) , the newspaper editors and owners operated a ruthless self @-@ censorship . Having worked for government , press barons Viscount Rothermere , Baron Beaverbrook ( in a sea of controversy ) , and Viscount Northcliffe all received titles . For these reasons , it has been concluded that censorship , which at its height suppressed only socialist journals ( and briefly the right wing The Globe ) had less effect on the British press than the reductions in advertising revenues and cost increases which they also faced during the war . One major loophole in the official censorship lay with parliamentary privilege , when anything said in Parliament could be reported freely . The most infamous act of censorship in the early days of the war was the sinking of HMS Audacious in October 1914 , when the press was directed not to report on the loss , despite the sinking being observed by passengers on the liner RMS Olympic and quickly reported in the American press ."

Because the river system was tidal as far as Hackney Wick , several of the mills were tide mills , including those at Abbey Mills and those at Three Mills , one of which survives . Construction of the New River in the seventeenth century to supply drinking water to London , with subsequent extraction by waterworks companies , led to a lowering of water levels , and the river was gradually canalised to maintain navigation . Significant changes occurred with the creation of the Lee Navigation in 1767 , which resulted in the construction of the Hackney Cut and the Limehouse Cut , allowing barges to bypass most of the back rivers . A major reconstruction of the rivers took place in the 1930s , authorised by the River Lee ( Flood Relief ) Act , but by the 1960s , commercial usage of the waterways had largely ceased .

Letts and Dicks enjoyed the script Nation sent in , but found it too \" reminiscent \" of many of his previous Dalek stories . The two suggested that Nation instead write an origin story for the Daleks , originally titled Daleks — Genesis of Terror . The serial was commissioned on 1 April 1974 , and the scripts accepted on 22 July . The stories lined up for the season were handed over to Letts and Dicks ' successors , producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes , with whom Genesis of the Daleks gained a darker tone . Holmes was not a fan of frequent appearances by the Daleks , and only allowed the story because it explored their origins . In an aim to make the series more adult , Hinchcliffe wanted the story to be \" pacy \" and make the Daleks appear more powerful . In a 2006 interview , Dicks said that he does not believe the story would have been much different if he and Letts were in charge , though he remarked he would have added some lighter moments to soften the \" grim \" tone . Director David Maloney stated that the images of war at the beginning of the serial were intended to create atmosphere , and he had no intention of losing the younger audience ."

    "text": "There were many types of clothing and different clothing trends in the Song period , yet clothes in China were always modeled after the seasons and as outward symbols of one 's social class . Coal used for heating one 's home was scarce and often expensive , so people often wore clothing with extra silk @-@ floss and fur @-@ lined coats in the winter . The clothing material preferred by the rich was silk , and for special occasions they had silk robes with gold brocade . The clothing material used by the poor was often hempen cloth , but cotton clothes were also used , the latter being most widely available in the south . The types of clothes worn by peasants and commoners were largely uniform in appearance ( with color standard of black and white ) , and so was the case for the upper class and elite . In fact , wealthy and leading members of society followed accepted guidelines and ritual requirements for clothing . In the upper class , each stratified grade in the social hierarchy was distinguished by the color and specific ornamentation of robes , the shape and type of headgear , and even the style of girdle worn . This rigid order was especially so during the beginning of the dynasty . However , the lines of hierarchy slowly began to blur as the color purple , once reserved solely for the attire of third rank officials or higher , began to diffuse amongst all ranks of officials who bore the color indiscriminately . Along with lower grade civil officials in the government protesting the rigid regulations for attire , the wealthy members of the merchant class also contributed to the disintegration of rules for ceremonial attire worn only by certain members of society . Yet there were still visible distinctions between civil officials and the class of rich merchants and business owners ; the officials were distinguished by their long robes reaching to the ground , while merchants often wore a blouse that came down below the waist with trousers . Pants and trousers were introduced to China during the Warring States in the 4th century BC , and were not exclusive to merchants ; every soldier wore trousers as part of his uniform , while trousers were also worn by the common people .

    "text": "During the nineteenth century , Mint employees produced unauthorized copies of medals and coins , sometimes backdated . Although coin restrikes were created openly at the Philadelphia Mint from the 1830s , the practice became clandestine by the end of the 1850s . In the decades after the first 1804 dollars were produced , collectors became aware of their existence and desired to obtain them . Several were struck at the Mint in 1858 . Those coins , which became known as \" Class II \" 1804 dollars , had plain , unlettered edges , as opposed to standard issue Draped Bust dollars and those struck as diplomatic gifts , all of which had edge lettering applied by the Castaing machine . In 1859 , James Ross Snowden unsuccessfully requested permission from the Treasury Secretary to create patterns and restrikes of rare coins for sale to collectors , and in that year , dealers began offering plain edge 1804 dollars to the public . At least three were offered for sale by various dealers in 1859 , and coin dealer Ebenezer Locke Mason claimed that he was offered three by Theodore Eckfeldt , a Mint employee and nephew of Adam Eckfeldt ( who had died in 1852 ) . After the public became aware that Mint officials had permitted restrikes , there was a minor scandal which resulted in a Congressional investigation and the destruction of outdated coinage dies . The controversy prompted William E. DuBois , Mint Assayer , to try , in 1860 , to recall the examples of the 1804 dollar in private hands . According to DuBois , five coins were known to be privately owned , of which four were recovered . He stated that three were destroyed in his presence , and one was added to the Mint 's coin cabinet ( of which he was curator , and which is today the National Numismatic Collection ) , where it remains today . The coin , which is the sole known Class II specimen in existence , was struck over an 1857 Swiss shooting thaler minted for a shooting festival in the Canton of Bern . The fifth coin , alluded to by DuBois , is not currently accounted for , although its edge may have been lettered after its recovery in an attempt to pass it as an original . Coins with added lettering are known as \" Class III \" 1804 dollars . The obverse coinage die used to strike the Class II and Class III 1804 dollars was deposited in safekeeping in 1860 , and the reverse die was destroyed in that year . The obverse die was defaced in 1869 ."

Ground improvements begun before the First World War left the club in financial difficulty during it ; the chairman of Darlington Forge Albion financed the completion of the East Stand and cleared the debts , allowing them to continue to compete .

Yet , in 1405 James was under the protection and tutelage of Bishop Henry Wardlaw of St Andrews on the country 's east coast . Douglas animosity was intensifying because of the activities of Orkney and Fleming who continued to expand their involvement in border politics and foreign relations with England . Although a decision to send the young prince to France and out of Albany 's reach was taken in the winter of 1405 – 06 , James 's departure from Scotland was unplanned . In February 1406 Bishop Wardlaw released James to Orkney and Fleming who , with their large force of Lothian adherents , proceeded into hostile Douglas east Lothian . James 's custodians may have been giving a demonstration of royal approval to further their interests in Douglas country . This provoked a fierce response from James Douglas of Balvenie and his supporters who , at a place called Long Hermiston Muir , engaged with and killed Fleming while Orkney and James escaped to the comparative safety of the Bass Rock islet in the Firth of Forth . They endured more than a month there before boarding the France @-@ bound Maryenknyght , a ship from Danzig . On 22 March 1406 the ship was taken by English pirates and James became the hostage of King Henry IV of England . Robert III was at Rothesay Castle when he learned of his son 's capture , and he died soon after on 4 April 1406 and was buried in the Stewart foundation abbey of Paisley ."

It is equally widely distributed across northern North America , extending north to Alaska , where it has been collected from tundra near Coldfoot in the interior of the state . In southwestern Greenland , P. involutus has been recorded under the birch species Betula nana , B. pubescens and B. glandulosa . The mushroom is more common in coniferous woods in Europe , but is also closely associated with birch ( Betula pendula ) . Within woodland , it prefers wet places or boggy ground , and avoids calcareous ( chalky ) soils . It has been noted to grow alongside Boletus badius in Europe , and Leccinum scabrum and Lactarius plumbeus in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . There it is found in both deciduous and coniferous woodland , commonly under plantings of white birch ( Betula papyrifera ) in urban areas . It is one of a small number of fungal species which thrive in Pinus radiata plantations planted outside their natural range . A study of polluted Scots pine forest around Oulu in northern Finland found that P. involutus became more abundant in more polluted areas while other species declined . Emissions from pulp mills , fertiliser , heating and traffic were responsible for the pollution , which was measured by sulfur levels in the pine needles ."

The Plains spadefoot toad ( Spea bombifrons ) is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the metatarsals of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground .

In winter , it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) . The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end .

This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors . Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships ' provisions , archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation . Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century , which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high , broken terrain . The human population on Mauritius ( an area of 1 @,@ 860 km2 or 720 sq mi ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century , but they introduced other animals , including dogs , pigs , cats , rats , and crab @-@ eating macaques , which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources . At the same time , humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos .

Bayern was listed as one of the ships to be handed over , though Baden initially was not . The battlecruiser Mackensen , which the British believed to be completed , was requested instead . When it became apparent to the Allies that Mackensen was still under construction , Baden was ordered to replace it . On 21 November 1918 , the ships to be interned , under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , sailed from their base in Germany for the last time . The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser HMS Cardiff , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British , American , and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow . Baden arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918 ."

A quality Arabian has both a relatively horizontal croup and a properly angled pelvis as well as good croup length and depth to the hip ( determined by the length of the pelvis ) , that allows agility and impulsion . A misconception confuses the topline of the croup with the angle of the \" hip \" ( the pelvis or ilium ) , leading some to assert that Arabians have a flat pelvis angle and cannot use their hindquarters properly . However , the croup is formed by the sacral vertebrae . The hip angle is determined by the attachment of the ilium to the spine , the structure and length of the femur , and other aspects of hindquarter anatomy , which is not correlated to the topline of the sacrum . Thus , the Arabian has conformation typical of other horse breeds built for speed and distance , such as the Thoroughbred , where the angle of the ilium is more oblique than that of the croup . Thus , the hip angle is not necessarily correlated to the topline of the croup . Horses bred to gallop need a good length of croup and good length of hip for proper attachment of muscles , and so unlike angle , length of hip and croup do go together as a rule ."

A cougar 's killing bite is applied to the back of the neck , head , or throat and they inflict puncture marks with their claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey , sometimes also shredding the prey as they hold on . Coyotes also typically bite the throat region but do not inflict the claw marks and farmers will normally see the signature zig @-@ zag pattern that coyotes create as they feed on the prey whereas cougars typically drag in a straight line .

    "text": "Wallace had once briefly met Darwin , and was one of the correspondents whose observations Darwin used to support his own theories . Although Wallace 's first letter to Darwin has been lost , Wallace carefully kept the letters he received . In the first letter , dated 1 May 1857 , Darwin commented that Wallace 's letter of 10 October which he had recently received , as well as Wallace 's paper \" On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species \" of 1855 , showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions , and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time . The second letter , dated 22 December 1857 , said how glad he was that Wallace was theorising about distribution , adding that \" without speculation there is no good and original observation \" while commenting that \" I believe I go much further than you \" . Wallace trusted Darwin 's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay , \" On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type \" , with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile . Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago , the Ternate essay was in a private letter . On 18 June 1858 , Darwin received the essay from Wallace . While Wallace 's essay obviously did not employ Darwin 's term \" natural selection \" , it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures . In this sense , it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years , but had yet to publish . Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying \" he could not have made a better short abstract ! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters ... he does not say he wishes me to publish , but I shall , of course , at once write and offer to send to any journal . \" Distraught about the illness of his baby son , Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker , who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin 's priority . Wallace had not asked for publication of his essay , and indeed , doing so probably contravened the copyright law of the time . Wallace 's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858 , along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857 ."

This has been attributed to a range of causes . Firstly , the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants , resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing . Secondly , disturbed populations usually lack an understorey , and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters ; instead , they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination . The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average , leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations ."

    "text": "Gry Mørk explains that in songs such as Burzum 's \" Musstad \" link manliness with Norse tradition and gender ideals , and that the Viking male thus represents traditional masculinity . Most of the Norse references in black metal are heroic , masculine , and militaristic in theme - Mjölner , Odin , the iron cross , and berserkers and einherjar . Conversely , Jesus , though a male figure , is seen in songs such as \" Jesu død \" by Burzum as cold , dark , and life @-@ extinguishing . Christianity is viewed as stigmatizing and suppressing the natural \" dark \" sides of men , and so , from the perspective of black metal , true masculinity is achieved through exploring the dark sides of man 's nature - warfare and killing . Mørk highlights the thesis of cultural historian Nina Witoszec that within Norway , images of nature are often symbolic with cultural affiliation to Norway . Witoszec traces the roots of this ideal to Tacitus 's German @-@ heathen identity narrative which romanticized the Germanic people as superior through their connection with nature , and whose brutality and belligerence opposed the apathetic and decadent Roman elite .

James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles ' vocals , which he called , \" icy and cool , slippery like mercury [ and ] nothing to scoff at either \" , help make the song an \" undeniable smash \" that is unique compared to the work of other artists . Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles ' \" fierce \" alter ego , who \" dares the listener to dream of her , warning that it might be a ' beautiful nightmare ' . \" Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that \" Sweet Dreams \" is another one of Jim Jonsin 's productions with a keyboard @-@ propelled arrangement , but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy , the song is \" swirling , and darker \" . Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle and Gary Trust of Billboard magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles ' purest dance songs and is \" an irresistible call to the dance floor \" . Describing \" Sweet Dreams \" as a \" cool dance track \" , Dennis Amith of J ! -ENT complimented its arrangement , calling it \" experimental \" with \" cool transitions \" ."

Object permanence is considered to be one of the earliest methods for evaluating working memory . An infant that has started to develop object permanence might reach for the toy or try and grab the blanket off the toy . Infants that have not yet developed this might appear confused . Piaget interpreted these behavioral signs as evidence of a belief that the object had ceased to exist . Reactions of most infants that had already started developing object permanence were of frustration because they knew it existed , but didn 't know where it was . However , the reaction of infants that had not yet started developing object permanence was more oblivious . If an infant searched for the object , it was assumed that they believed it continued to exist ."

    "text": "The first major study of Scottish hillforts was undertaken by General William Roy and published as The Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain in 1793 . However , Roy only recorded native forts like Burnswark that had a close relationship to Roman constructions ( in this case probably Roman practice siege camps ) , or which he wrongly attributed to be Roman in origin . George Chalmers ' ( 1742 – 1825 ) first volume of Caledonia ( 1807 ) contained an arbitrary list of forts , but recognised that defences at Burnswark were not just in anticipation of Roman invasion , but to defend against native threats . He also recognised some of the relationships between major and subordinate sites , and the importance of intervisibility between sites . In 1851 the Scots @-@ Canadian Daniel Wilson was the first person to use the term \" pre @-@ historic \" in English , but he was dismissive of the significance of hillforts . The first serious field research in Scotland was undertaken by David Christison , in the decade preceding his Rhind lectures of 1894 . This was the first comprehensive survey of hillforts in a region of Britain . It was critical of previous neglect of the subject and cautious in labelling all forts as prehistoric . His work was published in 1898 as Early Fortification of Scotland and became the model for subsequent national and regional studies ."

The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper . Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode \" Countrycide \" was deliberately structured in order to make the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life . For Davies , the dalliance is a \" human \" one , told in an adult manner characterised by \" lust and anger and hurt and the joy you get out of the initial stages of having an affair \" . Myles commented that Gwen 's compromised morality , as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience , and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were \" safe \" from temptation . Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen 's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character . Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate , Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a \" one @-@ dimensional paragon of virtue \" . Instead , the writers made Gwen more \" realistic \" by giving her \" distinct human failings \" , which Walker felt made her \" arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars \" .

The tail hairs served as flyswatters , bracelets , necklaces and thread . Shields , sandals and drums were made using the skin , and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons . The smoke from burning giraffe skins was used by the medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds . The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh ; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes . Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia ; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes , believed to be the giraffes ' ghosts by the Humr . In the 19th century , European explorers began to hunt them for sport . Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe , too : in the Sahel , the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation . Normally , giraffes can coexist with livestock , since they do not directly compete with them ."

Investigators Bryan Shearer and colleagues isolated another virulent pathogen that they identified as a species of Zythiostroma , however it appeared to invoke an immune response in the plant . This immune response , coupled with the fact that it had not been observed in the wild , led them to believe it was not a major pathogen of the species . This species has since been reclassified and named as Luteocirrhus shearii ."

Berkeley felt it was related to Agaricus ostreatus ( now Pleurotus ostreatus ) but remarked it was a \" far more magnificent species \" . Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist James Drummond in 1841 on Banksia wood along the Swan River . He wrote \" when this fungus was laid on a newspaper , it emitted by night a phosphorescent light , enabling us to read the words around it ; and it continued to do so for several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up . \" More material collected from near the base of a \" sickly but living \" shrub ( Grevillea drummondii ) was named as Agaricus lampas by Berkeley . He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species . Tasmanian botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn collected material in October 1845 from that state , which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less decurrent gills and a shorter stipe , and named it Agaricus phosphorus in 1848 . Italian mycologist Pier Andrea Saccardo placed all three named taxa in the genus Pleurotus in 1887 . These names have been synonymised with O. nidiformis , although the name Pleurotus lampas persisted in some texts , including the 1934 – 35 monograph of Australian fungi by John Burton Cleland . In reviewing the published literature , Victorian botanical liaison officer Jim Willis was aware of Rolf Singer 's placing of Pleurotus olearius into the genus Omphalotus , but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across , even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in Pleurotus . Investigating the species in 1994 , Orson K. Miller , Jr. gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus Omphalotus with other bioluminescent mushrooms ."

Crane 's work , however , cannot be determined by style solely on chronology . Not only does his fiction not take place in any particular region with similar characters , but it varies from serious in tone to reportorial writing and light fiction . Crane 's writing , both fiction and nonfiction , is consistently driven by immediacy and is at once concentrated , vivid and intense . The novels and short stories contain poetic characteristics such as shorthand prose , suggestibility , shifts in perspective and ellipses between and within sentences .

Such chapels drew their congregations from English people living in Scotland and from Scottish Episcopalians who were not bound to the Jacobite cause . These two forms of episcopalianism existed side by side until 1788 when the Jacobite claimant Charles Edward Stuart died in exile . Unwilling to recognise his brother Henry Benedict Stuart , who was a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church , as his heir , the non @-@ juror Episcopalians elected to recognise the House of Hanover and offer allegiance to George III .

The existing saddle , in use since 1796 , was considered too high , restricting the use of a rider 's lower legs , leading to instability . Accordingly , he designed a new saddle , with the assistance of the saddler sergeant at Maidstone depot , which focused on reducing rubbing against the horse , improved comfort and weighed less than the existing design . The resulting saddle was tested in April 1853 , with attendance by the Duke of Cambridge , inspector general of cavalry .

Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces , particularly xenon 133 . The equipment did fly over Germany , but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction . This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering . It would become extremely important after the war ."

After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 , Charles II encouraged the development of Portugal Street and the area to the north ( Mayfair ) and they became fashionable residential localities . Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of the street . Edward Hyde , 1st Earl of Clarendon and close political adviser to the king , purchased land for a house ; Clarendon House ( now the location of Albemarle Street ) was built in 1664 , and the earl sold the surplus land partly to Sir John Denham , who built what later became Burlington House . Denham chose the location because it was on the outskirts of London surrounded by fields . The house was first used to house the poor , before being reconstructed by the third Earl of Burlington in 1718 . Berkeley House was constructed around the same time as Clarendon House .

Instead of using the furnaces to heat air which is then used to dry the wheat , the hot smoke from the kilns is forced directly through the grain bed .

Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth . Daytime high temperatures usually range a few degrees below the freezing point . Major snowfalls can result from nor 'easter ocean storms moving up the east coast of North America . These major snowfalls typically average 20 – 30 cm ( 8 – 12 in ) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain . Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt , and this will cool onshore winds , which can extend inland as far as Moncton . The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably over the course of the last decade ( which may be a consequence of global warming ) , and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result . Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February . Trees are usually in full leaf by late May . Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate . Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) . Rainfall is generally modest , especially in late July and August , and periods of drought are not uncommon . Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October . First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December .

The team had arrived late for a game in Montreal and the game had been called at midnight , with a tied score . The league demanded that the game be replayed . The club agreed to play only if the game mattered in the standings . The impasse led to Ottawa leaving the league . For the rest of that winter , the club played only in Cup challenge series . Quebec went on to win the championship of the league and demanded the Stanley Cup , but the Cup 's trustees ruled that Ottawa still retained it . The trustees offered to arrange a challenge between Ottawa and the CAHL champion , but the CAHL refused to consider it . The next season , Ottawa joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League ( FAHL ) , winning the league championship . The club was only in the FAHL for one season , and the Montreal Wanderers became their new rival . For the 1906 season Ottawa , along with the Wanderers and several of the CAHL teams , formed the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) , unifying the top teams into one league ."

In 1887 , Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided , ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics .

The Soviet government had rejected outright his Armenian proposals , and obstructed an attempt by Nansen to help with the 1928 Ukrainian famine . Quisling took these rebuffs as a personal insult ; in 1929 , with the British now keen to take back control of their own diplomatic affairs , he left Russia . He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) for his services to Britain , an honour revoked by King George VI in 1940 .

    "text": "A second accusation , and one that proved even more controversial in the aftermath of the engagement , was the claim that Africaine 's crew abandoned their guns , refused to load them or deliberately fired them into the sea in protest at Corbet 's behaviour . Corbet 's brutality was well known in the Navy , James describing him as \" an excessively severe officer \" who had a \" career of cruelty \" . James does not accuse the crew of any deliberate attempt to sabotage their ship in the engagement , instead attributing their poor gunnery to Corbet 's own failings as a commander , most significantly his failure to practice gunnery regularly . Other authors were less understanding of the crew of Africaine , Brenton stating that \" they cut the breechings of their guns , and put no shot in them after the first or second broadside \" , while historian Basil Hall baldly stated in 1833 that they \" preferred to be mown down by the French broadsides \" than fight under Corbet . This last accusation provoked outrage among naval officers , and Captain Jenkin Jones , a former shipmate of Corbet launched a successful lawsuit , forcing Hall to make a retraction . In 1900 , William Laird Clowes commented that \" There is , unfortunately , much reason to suppose that Captain Corbett 's [ sic ] reputation for extreme severity had antagonised his crew , and that the men did not behave as loyally as they should have behaved \" . He later castigates Brenton for the suggestion that Corbet committed suicide , suggesting that the wound alone was the cause of death . Modern historians have also been scathing of Corbet 's behaviour , Robert Gardiner calling him \" notoriously brutal , \" and Richard Woodman describing Tullidge as \" an unfortunate victim of Corbet 's cruelty , for suspicions lingered that Africaine 's brutalised crew had failed to do their utmost in support of their hated commander . \""

This however ran counter to the desires of the Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King who , while speaking in the House of Commons of Canada in May 1922 , argued in favour of placing the memorial at Vimy Ridge .

She was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church . Her elder sister , Ilse , was born in 1909 and her younger sister , Margarete ( Gretl ) , was born in 1915 . Braun 's parents were divorced in April 1921 , but remarried in November 1922 , probably for financial reasons ( hyperinflation was plaguing the German economy at the time ) . Braun was educated at a Catholic lyceum in Munich , and then for one year at a business school in the Convent of the English Sisters in Simbach am Inn , where she had average grades and a talent for athletics . At age 17 she took a job working for Heinrich Hoffmann , the official photographer for the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . Initially employed as a shop assistant and sales clerk , she soon learned how to use a camera and develop photos . She met Hitler , 23 years her senior , at Hoffmann 's studio in Munich in October 1929 . He had been introduced to her as \" Herr Wolff \" . Eva 's sister , Gretl , also worked for Hoffman from 1932 onward , and the women rented an apartment together for a time .

The original plans had called for both a large and normal hill , but lack of funding meant that the normal hill was never built , meaning that the number of competitions in the hill would be severely limited . The cost overruns were largely created by errors in the plans , which estimated too little earthwork to fill the hillside , and not enough blasting . To cut costs , a floodlighting system was taken out of the plans , so the venue could not be used during the evenings , limiting the amount of time the venue could be used . It was also a concern that very few locals were able to jump on such a large hill . Many politicians stated in 1972 that the money should have been spent instead on an indoor hall for handball .

Potemkin opened up a lavish court at Jassy , the capital of Moldavia , to \" winter like a sultan , revel in his mistresses , build his towns , create his regiments — and negotiate peace with [ the Turks ] ... he was emperor of all he surveyed \" . Potemkin even established a newspaper , Le Courrier de Moldavie . His preferred lover at the time — though he had others — was Praskovia Potemkina , an affair which continued into 1790 . Potemkin renamed two ships in her honor . As part of the diplomatic machinations , Potemkin was given the new title of \" Grand Hetman of the Black Sea and Yekaterinoslav Cossack Hosts \" and in March he assumed personal control of the Black Sea fleet as Grand Admiral ."

The flotilla arrived off Great Yarmouth at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port , while the light cruiser Stralsund laid a minefield . The British submarine D5 responded to the bombardment , but struck one of the mines laid by Stralsund and sank . Shortly thereafter , Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters . While Hipper 's ships were returning to German waters , a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight , so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved so they could safely navigate the defensive minefields . The armored cruiser Yorck made a navigational error that led the ship into one of the German minefields . Yorck struck two mines and quickly sank ; the coastal defense ship Hagen was able to save 127 men of the crew ."
